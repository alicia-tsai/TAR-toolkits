(As of now, there is no technology yet anywhere in the world that can predict earthquakes.) 'Bagama't ganito, patuloy na minamatyagan ng DOST-PHIVOLCS ang mga lugar na pinagmumulan ng lindol upang magbigay ng sapat na abiso ayon sa nakalap na datos lalo na kapag may kakaibang nangyayari sa mga ito,' the agency added. (The DOST-Phivolcs continue to monitor the origins of earthquakes to provide alerts based from data that is available.) The earthquake on Monday was recorded in Castillejos town in Zambales and was felt in different parts of Luzon from Pangasinan to Metro Manila and to Camarines Norte. In 2017, rumors spread that earthquakes may be predicted as studies about the possible effects of the West Valley Fault were published. The fault line has not moved since it's last movement around 400 years ago. Despite the absence of earthquakes involving the West Valley Fault, the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) said that agencies like the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) are prepared for the worst scenario. 'The government agency in-charge of earthquakes in the country estimates that over 30,000 individuals may die and over 100,000 may be injured. In order to speed up the evacuation of residents and the rescue operations, the MMDA has divided Metro Manila into four quadrants,' the NCRPO said. These are: North (Caloocan, Valenzuela, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong); East (Pasig, Marikina); West (Manila Malabon, Navotas); and South (Las Piñas, Makati, Muntinlupa, Parañaque, Pateros, Taguig, Pasay."

2019-04-23,Philippines earthquake: Frantic hunt for survivors after deadly tremor,"Buildings collapse in Pamanga as rescuers scramble to find survivors in the rubble Rescue workers carry a survivor out of the collapsed Chuzon supermarket in Porac, Pampanga a day after a 6.3 magnitude earthquake. AFP Philippine rescuers were scrambling to reach dozens of people feared buried under a building that collapsed a day after powerful earthquake north of Manila. The 6.3-magnitude quake struck northwest of the capital on Monday, scientists from the US Geological Survey said, heavily damaging Clark International Airport and sending terrified locals fleeing swaying high-rises. The worst of the damage was in the province of Pampanga, which was the site of most of the 11 fatalities, disaster officials said. Dozens of others were injured by falling rubble, including in Manila. The death toll could rise as crews fanned out across the region to assess damage in isolated villages that lost power and communications in one of the area's strongest tremors in years. Over 400 aftershocks have been registered since the initial earthquake - some as strong as 3.4 magnitude - Philippine seismologists said. Scores of rescuers in the town of Porac worked with cranes and excavators to peel back the concrete structure of a four-storey market building where up to 30 people were unaccounted for. ""They [rescuers] still hear at least one person who is still alive,"" Pampanga Governor Lilia Pineda said. ""This person is buried under concrete slabs."" The earthquake also damaged several centuries-old churches which were crowded with worshippers in recent days as the majority-Catholic Philippines marked the Easter holiday. 'Really swaying' Father Roland Moraleja, who is based in Porac, said the 18th century belfry of Saint Catherine of Alexandria church collapsed in the earthquake. ""It was the only part left from the old church,"" he said. ""The historical value is now gone, but we are hopeful that it will rise again."" High-rise buildings in the capital swayed after the tremor struck Monday evening, leaving some with large cracks in their walls. Video footage emerged of water from a penthouse swimming pool crashing down to streets below. Thousands of travellers were stranded after aviation authorities shut down the secondary Clark Airport, which is located on the site of the former US military base that lies about an hour's drive north of the capital. It was still closed on Tuesday as officials assessed the heavy damage to the terminal building and some cracking on the air traffic control tower. The earthquake was centred on the town of Castillejos, about 100 kilometres northwest of Manila, local geologists said. Dani Justo, a martial arts instructor, told AFP she was at her southern Manila home when the quake struck. ""The clothes hanging on our line were really swaying. My shih tzu [dog] dropped flat on the ground,"" she added.. The government declared Tuesday a holiday for civil servants in Metro Manila to allow for safety inspections of buildings."

2019-04-23,Philippines Struck by Another Powerful Earthquake,"The Philippines was hit by a powerful earthquake on Tuesday afternoon, a day after a deadly tremor hit the north of the country. The earthquake on Tuesday registered a magnitude of 6.4 and was centered in Samar, an island in the central eastern part of the country, the United States Geological Survey said. The location is about 375 miles southeast of the magnitude-6.1 earthquake Monday that killed at least 16 people and shook buildings in Manila, the capital. Rescuers in a town near Manila were still searching on Tuesday for people trapped in a supermarket that collapsed in the Monday quake. At least five people died in the collapsed store, officials said. The Philippines, which sits at the intersection of multiple tectonic plates, sees frequent seismic activity and sometimes deadly earthquakes. Officials from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the two earthquakes this week did not appear to be connected. Many areas hit by the quake Monday, which was centered about 40 miles northwest of Manila, were still without power a day later. Electricity providers cut off supply to prevent fires while damage was still being assessed. About 120 families were evacuated. Schools and government work in affected areas was suspended to allow for building inspections and rescue work. In Samar, the mayor of the city of Catbalogan, Archie Fuentes, said he saw five houses destroyed. “There were many damaged structures,” Mr. Fuentes said. “Tiles fell off the walls. I called off work today for government offices in the afternoon. We are on a 24-hour alert.” One person was reported to have been injured by falling debris. “People panicked at first,” Mr. Fuentes said over DZBB radio in Manila. “There is still fear as of now.” Col. Michael David, police chief of the coastal city of Tacloban, which was badly damaged by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, said people there also panicked on Tuesday. The Asian Development Foundation College in the city was damaged, but no one was immediately reported to have been injured. “We have not been hit hard,” Colonel David said. “But people are struggling with fear and trauma as rumors quickly spread of a tsunami.” “Please don’t panic,” he pleaded over local radio. “There is no tsunami alert.” Mr. David said people had evacuated their homes and offices after the initial shaking, but quickly went back. “Right now, we have not noticed anything different from the sea. It is normal,” he said. “We are assessing the damage. The city hall is safe and sound.”"
2019-04-23,DOT: Review travel plans to earthquake-affected areas,"The Department of Tourism (DOT) has encouraged tourists to ""review"" any of their travel plans to the areas affected by the 6.1 magnitude earthquake that jolted parts of Luzon Monday afternoon. ""We ask those planning to visit the affected areas to review their travel plans and allow our authorities to complete their urgent tasks for now,"" said Tourism Undersecretary Benito Bengzon Jr. in a text message sent to the Manila Bulletin. Bengzon said that the tourism department is coordinating with other government agencies that are involved in the response operations. ""At the moment, our main priority is to coordinate with other government agencies that are still involved in the search and rescue [operations],"" said Bengzon. Bengzon also expressed their ""deepest sympathies to the families of the victims of the recent earthquake."" According to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), the earthquake hit parts of Luzon at around 5:11 p.m. on Monday with its epicenter in Castillejos, Zambales.

2019-04-23,Employers vow to establish post-earthquake protocols,"The Employers' Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) on Tuesday said it will make the establishment of ""post-earthquake safety protocols"" a priority agenda when members convene for the National Conference of Employers (NCE) this May. ECOP Chair Emeritus Francis Chua, in a reaction to organized labor's call for employers to ensure that office buildings are inspected and rendered structurally sound before letting their employees return to work after an earthquake, told the Philippine News Agency that this ""point is well taken."" But ""we need to convene, and make this (new safety protocols) as one of our priority agenda in our NCE this May,"" Chua said. Chua admits that ECOP as an organization does not have protocols that automatically kick-in in the aftermath of a disaster ""because the government is doing a great job."" He added, however, that individual companies may have their own disaster response policies on a case to case basis. ""Our directors and members always help employees affected by earthquakes and other disasters,"" he explained. The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) made the call after a magnitude 6.1 earthquake rocked parts of Luzon on Monday, shortly after 5:11 p.m., leaving at least 14 dead in Porac and Lubao towns of Pampanga. The quake, also felt in Metro Manila, caused thousands of private and public sector employees to hastily evacuate their offices and sought safety in open spaces. TUCP officials said Tuesday that they are acting on reports from workers and employees, who were not evacuated but instead were ordered to report back for work despite the dangers in the immediate aftermath of the quake. This may be construed as a form of abuse due to perils posed to the employees' health and safety, the union officials added. ECOP, formed in September 1975, and envisioned as the voice of Philippine employers on labor and social policy towards the pursuit of national development, will convene its members for the 40th NCE, with theme ""Future Proofing Business and Industry"" at the Marriott Grand Ballroom from May 28 to 29."

2019-04-25,"PNP eyes raps vs Porac execs, supermarket owner","Charges could be filed against local officials of Porac, Pampanga and the owner of a supermarket that collapsed during a strong earthquake last Monday, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Oscar Albayalde said yesterday.  He said Samuel Chu, owner of the four-story Chuzon Supermarket in Porac, could face a civil suit after at least 12 people died in the incident. Chu and local officials who issued the building permits could face criminal charges for reckless imprudence resulting in multiple homicide and physical injuries if there is substantial evidence to prove that the supermarket was constructed using substandard materials.  Albayalde said Porac officials who issued the permits to the supermarket might have violated the Building Code. He clarified that probers of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) are still gathering statements from survivors and relatives of the dead as well as documents related to the supermarket's construction.  ""We will file a case once we get all the statements of those who are interested to file,"" Albayalde said. He said they are also waiting for the assessment of engineers from the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).  The PNP has activated search and rescue teams to assist in rescue operations in Porac, Pampanga. Maj.  Gen. Ma-O Aplasca, PNP director for operations, ordered the deployment of teams from the National Capital Region Police Office, Special Action Force, Maritime Group, Crime Laboratory Ilocos Region police to assist in search and rescue.  National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) spokesman Edgar Posadas said that as of yesterday, there was no sign of life underneath the rubble. ""We are still on search and rescue operations as we have yet to account for the 14 individuals who were reported missing,"" Posadas said.  He said search and rescue continuefloor to floor, starting from the rooftop of the establishment. The operations, he added, will continue until the last areas where these missing individuals could possibly be found have been thoroughly searched.  ""We Filipinos never say die. What's important for us now  good or bad  is to returnthe missing individuals to their respective families,"" Posadas.  He added that for now, all they could hope for is that the missing 14 were somewhere else and not inside the supermarket when the quake struck. Five persons died while nine others were rescued from the Chozun Supermarket, where 86 others sustained injuries.  As of yesterday, the NDRRMC reported that 542 houses, 142 of them totalled, were damaged by the magnitude 6.1 quake that jolted Central Luzon, specifically Pampanga, Bataan and Zambales provinces.  The quake also affected 1,203 families or 4,991 individuals in the affected cities and towns in Central Luzon. In Samar, 21 persons were injured when a magnitude 6. 5 quake shook the province Tuesday. The strong tremor also affected 68 families or 272 persons from 13 villages in Eastern Samar.  The quake also damaged 67 houses, four of which were totally destroyed, the NDRRMC, in an updated report said. Damaged bridges  Public Works Secretary Mark Villar said that three bridges, including the Guadalupe Bridge in Makati City, sustained minor cracks as a result of the magnitude 6. 1 earthquake last Monday. In a statement, Villar said that they have so far inspected 275 national bridges, flyovers and viaducts in Metro Manila wherein they noted three bridges to have sustained minor damage.  The Guadalupe Bridge had a crack on the girder while the Tenejeros and Tanza bridges both in Malabon City suffered minor cracks at the railings. But the DPWH explained that the Guadalupe Bridge is already being prepared for major retrofitting under the department's Unified Project Management Office.  Tanza Bridge will undergo a second stage inspection while the minor damage on Tenejeros Bridge does not require immediate repair since the railings do not carry load. The DPWH had also inspected 452 school buildings and 142 other public buildings in the metropolis.  A total of 53 school buildings in Metro Manila have minor damage, mostly cracks on walls, columns, beams and ceiling, but three school buildings in Las Piaas were recommended for immediate structural evaluation. The DPWH identified one of the schools as the Las Piaas National High School (M.  Villar Building) that reportedly sustained large cracks on the corridor wall and flooring from the second to third floor. Cracks were also seen at the separation of the wall from beam to column.  The other schools are the Las Piaas North National High School (Department of Education [DepEd] Building) found with multiple major cracks and wall near the stairs while the Captain Albert Aguilar (CAA) National High School High School (Annex Building) had major cracks from ground floor to the second floor. Villar said they are coordinating with DepEd for the restoration especially of structures with major damage.  DPWH-National Capital Region director Ador Canlas yesterday said that based on their ongoing assessment of national roads and bridges, Metro Manila sustained minor damage and only had ""minimal impact"" from the tremor last Monday. Immediately after the quake, the department deployed rapid assessment teams to check on the condition of the national roads and bridges in the metropolis.  The DPWH also has an ongoing retrofitting program of bridges that helps strengthen these structures and ensure that they would be able to withstand strong earthquakes. On the leaning building of the Emilio Aguinaldo College (EAC) in Ermita, Manila, Canlas said there is a composite team conducting further investigation into the condition of the structure.  Immediately after seeing posts in social media that the EAC building along San Marcelino Street was leaning on another building, they sent a rapid assessment team and closed it off to students. As to reports that parts of Metro Manila are prone to liquefaction, Canlas said that there are hazard maps, even those that pinpoint the areas prone to liquefaction, that are with the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).  But he believes that even if there are areas prone to liquefaction, there are remedies that would improve a building's resiliency against strong earthquakes. ""As far as I know, there are building designs that have provisions for liquefaction factor, seismic factor and others. "" The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) pushed for the adoption of a new policy to protect workers during earthquake and other calamities. TUCP president Raymond Mendoza said there are no existing government standards that address workplace safety and health during emergency situations such as earthquake, fire and other disasters.  Mendoza said mandatory workplace emergency protocol standards are necessary after the recent earthquake showed that many employers refused to evacuate their employees and maintained a business as usual attitude. He said some companies adopt their own evacuation protocols and hire safety officers and implement safety evacuation plans voluntarily, but many firms do not have or are even unaware of such employee evacuation procedures.  The Act Strengthening Compliance With Occupational Safety and Health Standards and Providing Penaltiesmandates employers and contractors to provide a safe and healthy workplace. However, Mendoza said there's still a need to craft specific implementing rules and regulations of the law that governs this emergency scenario such as earthquakes.  Reelectionist Sen. Sonny Angara renewed his call to make disaster risk education mandatory in the curriculum of primary schools to improve the young learners' understanding of preparedness and response, as well as hone their readiness in dealing with natural calamities to foster a culture of preparedness among Filipinos.  ""Since we live in a country where earthquakes and typhoons are very common, it is imperative that every Filipino is equipped with the basic understanding and knowledge of disaster preparedness and response,"" Angara said. ""We can start by teaching our children how to prepare for and respond to different types of calamities.  We have to produce a generation that knows how to deal with threats posed by natural disasters and climate change,"" said Angara. Angara's proposal to require disaster awareness and mitigation education in primary schools formed part of Senate Bill 1994 which he filed last year.  The bill primarily seeks to create the Department of Disaster Resilience  a single, independent and permanent government agency devoted to disaster management. Bataan Rep.  Geraldine Roman, chair of the House committee on disaster management, called on the Senate to hasten approval of their long-approved bill that seeks the creation of a Department ofDisaster Resilience (DDR), especially after a series of major earthquakes hit the country. ""There is no need to further explain why we need this department now,"" Roman said in reference to House Bill 8165 establishing the DDR.  ""I strongly advocate for the speedy passage of HB 8165, the bill creating the DDR,"" she said of the measure that has been approved in plenary in 2018 with a vote of 181-5 and two abstentions. ""This bill has already been approved by the House. "" She likewise called on ""all government departments, offices and officials concerned to conduct inspections in all affected areas without delay."" The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) will provide a calamity fund for Pampanga to help residents affected by the tremor.  Sandra Cam, member of the PCSO board of directors, said the amount of calamity funds they will allocate will be determined after the conduct of an assessment. Cam and a team of PCSO officers went to Porac, Pampanga the other day to inspect the damage caused by the quake."
2019-04-26,"Philippines : Phivolcs, reminds of the misunderstanding of earthquakes","The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS-DOST) reminds the public against the erroneous information following the magnitude 6.1 earthquake in different parts of Luzon Monday afternoon and magnitude 6.5 earthquake in several Visayas areas Tuesday. In their Facebook post , Phivolcs was uncovered that they did not give a prediction of the earthquake. It is said, there is no worldwide technology that can provide information when it comes to a powerful earthquake. However, however, Phivolcs has assured that they will keep track of the areas of the earthquake to provide adequate warnings based on available data, especially if there is an unusual occurrence in these areas. The agency called on the public not to send or inflate any information that could further bring fear and anxiety to readers in the wrong post. Urged to Phivolcs the only people to visit their website and social media accounts for proper information. Malacaang also called on the public not to erase misleading information on social media to bring alarms, fears and anxieties to the people, but said the cooperation and cooperation of all were necessary. According to Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo by Phivolcs, monitoring the Palace earthquake that hit various areas of the country. The government is assuring that relevant agencies are able to respond and help those affected by the earthquake. The staff of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the affected local governments are working together. Panelo added that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the  Department of Energy (DOE) have been alerted to address the problems of transportation and electricity supply."
2019-04-26,Stronger building code needed – Enrile,"FORMER Senate president Juan Ponce Enrile has raised the need to establish a strong building code following the earthquakes that hit Metro Manila, Central Luzon, and Eastern Visayas this week. The Puwersa ng Masang Pilipino (PMP) Senate candidate said the recent tremors were a wake-up call for Filipinos that the country is within the earthquake belt. ""We need to estab2lish a rigid building code that will be enforced rigidly as well. It's time to do this because it is an emergent problem and it is a necessity to protect the people,"" Enrile said as he concluded his northern Luzon campaign sortie in Nueva Ecija. ""I commiserate with the people affected by the last earthquake that happened in Metro Manila and in Central Luzon, especially in Pampanga,"" he added. Enrile, who is seeking a fifth term in the Senate, warned that buildings and other infrastructure might collapse if the ""Big One,"" a huge earthquake that the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology has warned about, occurs. ""We must prepare for it, and one of the preparations that we should make right now, not tomorrow, is to establish a strong building code that can meet any kind of earthquake. I think this is a wake-up call for us to realize that we are within the so-called earthquake belt of this planet and we have to accept that,"" Enrile said. He noted that the deadly impact of recent tremors should be a warning and prompt the people to prepare for stronger earthquakes especially in Metro Manila."
2019-04-27,Death toll from philippine earthquake rises to 16,"Here is the text of news released by official news agency Bernama on its website:  - The death toll from Monday's 6.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the northern Philippines has risen to 16, Xinhua news agency reported, quoting the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Tuesday.  Ricardo Salad, executive director of the council, said the earthquake also left 81 people injured while 14 others remained missing in central Luzon provinces of Pampanga and Zambales.  Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said Monday's earthquake was detected at a depth of 12 km about 18 km northeast of Castillejos, a town in Zambales province in the western part of Luzon.  Following the first earthquake on Monday, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck Eastern Samar province in the central Philippines at 1.37pm local time on Tuesday.  No casualties and damage have been reported yet from this earthquake. "
2019-04-27,MVP-led companies bring aid to earthquake-affected areas,"Companies led by business titan Manuel V. Pangilinan have joined forces to provide aid in Porac, Pampanga, which was badly hit by the recent 6. 1-magnitude earthquake. PLDT provided free Fibr Link at the Command Center in Porac, which various government agencies used to communicate the strong quake's aftermath that happened last Monday.  Wireless unit Smart Communications also set up free calls and charging stations. PLDT, PLDT-Smart Foundation (PSF) and TV5's Alagang Kapatid Foundation distributed meals to responders and affected residents, while Maynilad Water Services gave bottled drinking water.  PSF also distributed 250 relief packages to families affected by the earthquake. The private sector-led Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF) that Pangilinan co-chairs has also deployed search and rescue teams, response coordination, logistic support, food and water, medical assistance and temporary shelters.  The efforts of the MVP consortium's Tulong Kapatid also focused on assisting in the rescue efforts. Meralco and Philex Mining Corp.  have dispatched rescue teams to help find survivors of the collapsed building in Porac, with the electric company providing the generator sets, floodlights, and heavy equipment.

2019-04-27,Devastating 'faults' of the 'Big One',"Earthquakes occur quite frequently in the Philippines due largely to its location. The country lies along the 'Pacific Ring of Fire,' home to several tectonic plate boundaries that stretch from Indonesia to the coast of Chile within a 40,000-km arc of seismic violence that triggers volcanic eruptions and unleashes earthquakes almost every day. Three tectonic plates that encircle the country are the Philippine Plate in the East; the Eurasian Plate in the West; and the Indo-Australian Plate in the South. The existence of several fault lines across the country is a manifestation of the movements of these tectonic plates. A fault line is defined as a geological fracture wherein the movement of masses of rock has displaced parts of the Earth's crust. A rapid movement of a fault line may produce a powerful energy that can trigger a strong earthquake. There are five active fault lines in the country namely the Western Philippine Fault, the Eastern Philippine Fault, the South of Mindanao Fault, Central Philippine Fault and the Marikina/Valley Fault System. Santa Catalina de Alejandria Parish Church in Porac, Pampanga. -GRIG C. MONTEGRANDE 'The Big One' In Metro Manila, the 'Big One' applies to a scenario wherein movements along the Valley Fault System could trigger a 7.2-magnitude quake. The East Valley Fault straddles 10 kilometers in Rizal province while the West Valley Fault runs over more than 100 km through the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Cavite and Laguna, and Metro Manila. Scientists claimed that the 100-km fault, which last moved in 1658, moves every 400 years, meaning the threat of a 7.2-magnitude quake is getting closer. Over the years, the Philippines has suffered a history of destructive and frequent earthquakes. Destruction of buildings and the loss of lives are not limited to the epicenter and nearby cities of the earthquake. On Aug. 2, 1968, an earthquake, felt at Intensity 8, had its epicenter in Casiguran, Aurora. But it was felt as far as Manila, where 270 people were killed and 261 others were hurt mostly due to the collapse of the Ruby Tower in the Binondo district. On Mar. 17, 1973, the municipality of Calauag in Quezon province was the worst hit by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Ragay Gulf. At least 98 houses were totally destroyed and 270 others were partially damaged. In Brgy. Sumulong in the same town, 70 percent of the school buildings were damaged. A 7.9-magnitude earthquake on Aug. 17, 1976 left more than 5,000 dead; 2,288 missing; and 9,928 injured in Regions IX and XII. The tremor happened just after midnight when most people were sleeping. A tsunami that devastated more than 700 km of coastline, struck from different directions, catching residents in the area unaware. On Aug. 17, 1983, a 6.5-magnitude, Intensity 7 earthquake was felt in Laoag City and the municipality of Pasuquin in Ilocos Norte. A number of reinforced concrete buildings either totally crumbled or sustained major structural damage beyond rehabilitation. The most heavily damaged structures in Laoag City are those near the Laoag River flood plain and along reclaimed stream channels. On Feb. 8, 1990, a 6.8-magnitude earthquake, which was felt at Intensity 8, hit the municipalities of Jagna, Duero and Guindulman in Bohol. About 3,000 houses, buildings and churches were damaged, of which 182 totally collapsed, including two historical churches. The bridge connecting Jagna and Duero also collapsed while the roads to the municipality of Anda sustained cracks and fissuring. Landslides and rockfalls blocked portions of the roads that caused inaccessibility to some areas between Anda and Garcia Hernandez. Six fatalities were reported and more than 200 were injured. About 46,000 people were displaced and at least 7,000 of them were rendered homeless. Damages to property was estimated to reach P154 million. The 7.7-magnitude earthquake on July 16, 1990 shook the northern part of Luzon. Caused by strikes and slips in the Digdig Fault and with an epicenter in Nueva Ecija province, the earthquake devastated Baguio City, which was 50 km away. Damage to buildings, infrastructure and property, mostly in Dagupan City and Baguio City, amounted to roughly P10 billion. At least 1,621 were killed. The 1990 earthquake prompted the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology to develop a software for Rapid Earthquake Damage Assessment System. On Nov. 15, 1994, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake affected 13 municipalities or a total of 273 barangays in Oriental Mindoro. About 22,452 families were affected, 78 people were killed and 430 were injured. PACIFIC RING OF FIRE The Ring of Fire is a major area in the basin of the Pacific Ocean where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The western portion is more complex, with a number of smaller tectonic plates that collide with the Pacific plate from Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Bougainville, Tonga, and New Zealand. Movements within the Earth's crust cause stress to build up at weak points, and rocks to deform. Damaged infrastructure include 24 bridges, eight of which were rendered impassable for days, isolating villages and towns. Three major power plants, two of which are connected to the Luzon grid and one to the Visayas grid, tripped during the earthquake, causing brownouts in Mindoro Island and parts of Leyte and Samar. A 5.1-magnitude earthquake, felt at an Intensity 7, rocked Bayugan, Agusan del Sur province on June 7, 1999. Poorly built structures collapsed, while posts and foundations of buildings sank or tilted. Two days later, a 5.0-magnitude earthquake was felt at Intensity 6 in Talacogon, Agusan del Sur. The earthquake caused damages to bridges, roads, schools, a commercial complex, a telephone station and the municipal hall of the town of Talacogon. On Oct. 15, 2013, the 7.2-magnitude earthquake, felt at Intensity 7, in Tagbilaran City, Bohol caused major destruction in the province. This was one of the strongest earthquakes to hit the country in recent years. Total damage was estimated at over P2.2 billion, devastating Central Visayas particularly the provinces of Bohol and Cebu. More than 200 persons were killed and over 14,000 structures, including historical buildings and churches were destroyed. Phivolcs described the Intensity 7 tremor as destructive, frightening people and causing them to run outdoors for safety. 'People find it difficult to stand in upper floors. Heavy objects and furniture overturn or topple. Big church bells may ring. Old or poorly built structures suffer considerable damage. Some well-built structures are slightly damaged. Some cracks may appear on dikes, fish ponds, road surfaces, or concrete hollow block walls. Limited liquefaction, lateral spreading and landslides are observed. Trees are shaken strongly,' Phivolcs earlier said. The agency defined liquefaction as a process wherein loose saturated sand lose strength during an earthquake and behave like liquid. Sources: Inquirer Archives, phivolcs.gov.ph, pna.gov.ph Kathleen de Villa and Marielle Medina, Inquirer Research Major earthquakes Earthquakes with a 7 to 8 magnitude are considered as major quakes that can cause considerable damage near the epicenter. Shallow-seated or near-surface major earthquakes when they occur under the sea, may generate tsunamis. Aftershocks are those that occur after the largest shock of an earthquake series. These are smaller than the main shock and may continue over a period of weeks, months, or even years. Earthquakes are said to come unexpectedly, shock after shock. The Philippines has done little in updating its building code, which would have enabled structures in the country to better adapt to the destructive forces of nature. Issues and concerns over the implementation and proper inspection of buildings and houses during construction also remain. 'We are better prepared than before,' Phivolcs Director Renato Solidum was earlier quoted as saying. 'But we need to do more. For earthquake preparedness, it's not just the people who should be preparing, but the buildings have to also be structured properly.' Local governments should be more strict in building inspection and in the issuance of permits for building design and construction, he further noted, adding that 'we have a good building code, but unfortunately, this is not always followed.' Solidum also emphasized the need to educate people, pointing out that 'most people would not know the basic structural standards unless they are engineers.'"
