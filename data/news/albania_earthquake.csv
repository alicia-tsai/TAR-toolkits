2019-11-27,Search for survivors in the rubble continues after Albania quake; ALBANIA EARTHQUAKE,EFE Newswire - Americas in Focus,,"Emergency operations continued in Albania Wednesday in an attempt to rescue any remaining survivors from the rubble after a powerful earthquake shook the entire country leaving at least 30 dead. A 6.4 magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale rattled Albania in the early hours of Tuesday. Rescue teams, supported by civil protection experts from other European countries, are working tirelessly in Thumana and Durres, north of the Albanian capital, in an attempt to find survivors. Both places registered the highest number of deaths after several buildings collapsed. Between 10 and 25 people remain missing, although data is not accurate, and it is thought the individuals may be spread across a dozen partially collapsed buildings and hotels. ""This house right here is of my family, my relatives, and for two days they are fighting to survive,"" Lirica, an Albanian woman who lives in Tirana but has family in Durres, told efe-epa. ""We have no clue what is happening. ""They tried to take out three yesterday and six more are there. ""A mother with three kids and then the daughter of another one and also the guy,"" Lirica, who was in Tirana at the time the earthquake struck, added. ""We have found a completely destroyed house and we have been told that there are six people under the rubble, we are working without pause since last night,"" Luca Cari, Italian fire brigade spokesman, told efe-epa. So far emergency teams have been able to rescue 45 people and the number of injured needing treatment has exceeded 650, of which eight remain in critical condition. Early in the morning, the bodies of a couple who have been named as Pellumb and Celike Greku were found. The pair's son was rescued on Tuesday but died overnight in the hospital. He was found in one of the collapsed buildings in Thumana. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama called a meeting in the early hours of Wednesday morning where he declared a state of emergency during the next month in Tirana and Durres. Some 2,500 people have had to spend the night in tents in the Durres football stadium. Wednesday will be a day of national mourning in Albania and Kosovo, in honor of the victims. Official acts and sports activities have been canceled for the entire day. The earthquake occurred at around 4.00 am local time on Tuesday. The epicenter was in the Adriatic Sea, 10 kilometers north of the city of Durres and 40 kilometers west of Tirana, the US Geological Survey (USGS). During the hours after the earthquake, there were more than 300 aftershocks. A magnitude 5.4 earthquake shook Bosnia with an epicenter 75 kilometers south of Sarajevo. On Wednesday a magnitude 6.1 earthquake rattled the island of Crete in southern Greece, according to the Geodynamic Institute of the National Observatory of Athens. The quake had a focal depth of 71 kilometers and occurred at 9.23 local time. Its epicenter was located in the sea between the islands of Crete and Anticitera, about 20 kilometers south of the latter and 258 kilometers south of Athens, the capital of the country. Civil Protection officers told Efe that so far they have not received emergency calls or registered victims, although considerable material damage was recorded. The tremor was felt not only in Crete, the largest island in Greece, but in several parts of the country, including Athens. The president of the seismic planning agency, Efthymios Lekkas, said in statements to local media that this tremor is not related to the 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Albania."
2019-11-27,Albania: Albania earthquake: Biggest quake in decades takes deadly toll,Deutsche Welle,https://www.dw.com/en/albania-biggest-earthquake-in-decades-takes-deadly-toll/a-51414371,"Albania has been hit by a powerful nighttime earthquake that has killed at least 14 people and injured hundreds more. Hours later, another quake rattled southern Bosnia. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit Albania early on Tuesday morning, triggering several building collapses and 14 deaths. At least 600 people were injured in the strongest earthquake to hit the Balkan nation in decades. The epicenter was 10 kilometers (6 miles) northwest of Shijak, between Durres and the capital Tirana, at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, according to the US Geological Survey. A man in his 50s was killed while jumping out of a building during the tremor, according to officials. Others were killed in building collapses in the coastal city of Durres and in Thuman. One of those killed was an elderly woman who saved her grandson by cradling him with her body, emergency workers told local media. Bosnia rattled Hours later, a magnitude-5.2 quake shook parts of southern Bosnia, around 75 kilometers (45 miles) south the capital Sarajevo, according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center. There were no immediate reports of injuries or structural damage. Albania searches through rubble Rescue crews used excavators to search collapsed buildings for survivors. Local television broadcast footage of rescuers pulling a young boy from a collapsed building after an excavator moved a broken slab of concrete and people pulled mangled reinforcement bars out of the way. President Ilir Meta told journalists that ""the situation is very dramatic. All efforts are being done to take the people out of the ruins.'' He called on the Cabinet to request international assistance. Neighboring Kosovo was sending an emergency team to help with rescue efforts, while the European Union and the United States both offered immediate have all offered immediate support. By late morning, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, Turkey, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia were sending rescue assistance. About 400 soldiers were erecting tents in two towns to shelter people with damaged houses. Tuesday's quake was the second to hit the country in two months and was felt along the Adriatic coast. Family trapped One unidentified man told local television that his daughter and niece were trapped in the rubble of an apartment building. ""I talked with my daughter and niece on the phone. They said they are well and are waiting for the rescue. I could not talk to my wife. There are other families, but I could not talk to them,"" the man said. National police warned people in affected areas to avoid driving so emergency services could reach victims, but also to stay out of buildings for fear of further collapses in aftershocks. Three hours after the inital tremor, a strong aftershock was felt in Tirana. Prime Minister Edi Rama said all government agencies were ""intensively working to save lives at the fatal spots in Durres and Thumane."" ""It is a dramatic moment where we should preserve calmness, stay alongside each other to cope with this shock,'' Rama wrote on his Facebook page. A 5.6-magnitude earthquake hit Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, in September, damaging about 500 houses and destroying others. The latest quake was reportedly also felt in the southern Italian regions of Puglia and Basilicata. In 1979 the region was hit by a magnitude-6.9 earthquake, causing damage along the southern Adriatic coast of then-Yugoslavia. There was widespread damage to buildings and more than 100 people died, but the most consequences were mainly restricted to modern-day Montenegro."
2019-11-27,Source: Albania Earthquake Did Not Damage TAP,Turan Information Agency,,"An earthquake in Albania with a magnitude of 6.4 on the 9-point Richter scale - the strongest in the country over the past half century - did not damage the 215-kilometer section of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) in that country, an informed source at the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) told ASTNA. &quot;According to information at the end of the day on November 26, TAP in Albania is not damaged,&quot; he said. Note that more than two dozen people died and hundreds were injured due to this earthquake, which affected both the capital of Albania, Tirana, and the west and north of the country. Shocks were felt in Greece, Italy (countries through which TAP passes), and even in Bulgaria and Turkey. Italian television even featured experts who commented on the impact of the Balkan earthquake on the construction of the TAP, stressing that there is no cause for serious concern so far. As an informed source in SOCAR noted in an interview with ASTNA, the TAP project has been implemented at 91% and only yesterday work began on filling the TAP with gas from Turkey to Greece. &quot;The Greek section is the longest (550 km out of 878 km of the total length of the gas pipeline), and it will be filled for several months. Gas may reach Albania by the summer of 2020. Of course, the Albanian section after the earthquake can undergo additional testing (with water under pressure), and now there""s no need to worry about it,"" he stressed. The Greek Prime Minister, who was at the talks in Rome on November 26, ordered assistance from Albania, and the Greek Foreign Minister went to Tirana. Note that TAP worth 4.5 billion euros is the final section of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC), designed to deliver the first Azerbaijani gas (from the second phase of the Shah Deniz field) to Europe from the end of 2020. The initial TAP capacity will be 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year with the possibility of bringing it up to 24 bcm per year. At the beginning of the week, TAP consortium managing director Luca Sceppati said that ""the coming months are crucial to ensure that the TAP pipeline is commissioned and tested for readiness for commercial gas supplies to Europe by October 2020. At the same time, we are preparing for commercial activities as an operator transmission systems and an independent transmission operator. &quot; &quot;TAP will provide a direct and cost-effective route for transporting gas to the countries of Southeast Europe and beyond,&quot; says L. Skeppati. TAP shareholders are: BP - 20 percent, SOCAR - 20 percent, Snam - 20 percent, Fluxys - 19 percent, Enag&aacute;s - 16 percent, Axpo - five percent. It is noteworthy that the leaders of the Italian Snam and the Spanish Enag&aacute;s received awards on November 26 for promoting the development of economic cooperation between Italy and Spain, and they stated that TAP is an important project in this regard and is included in the strategic development plans of these companies for the medium term. Spain will not receive gas from the Caspian Sea at the first stage of the development of the SGC, but may acquire it in case of expansion of the SGC. Starting July 1, 2019, companies interested in expanding will inform TAP about their prospective volumes for a possible second stage of SGC. &quot;According to EU rules, current TAP investor-shareholders do not have information about new companies that are interested in expanding TAP. Perhaps the situation will become clearer in 2020,&quot; SOCAR spokesman told ASTNA. The recipients of the first Azerbaijani gas for 25 years from Shah Deniz-2 will be 9 companies operating in Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. TAP will cover 33% of the gas demand in Bulgaria, 20% in Greece, and about 10.5% in Italy."
2019-11-27,"Albania earthquake: Tears, prayers in village near epicenter",Deutsche Welle World,https://www.dw.com/en/albania-earthquake-tears-prayers-in-village-near-epicenter/a-51442555,"The Albanian village of Thumane experienced the worst destruction in this week's earthquake. Residents there have celebrated rescues and mourned deaths as emergency crews search the rubble for survivors. The Albanian village of Thumane was hit hard by Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude earthquake. Emergency services are now working around the clock to find and rescue locals. When someone is pulled from the rubble alive, villagers applaud and breathe a sigh of relief. When all rescuers can do is retrieve a dead body from the wreckage, villagers weep in sorrow. At least 26 people were killed by the quake and some 650 more injured.  Albanian and international emergency teams use the heavy equipment that has arrived on the scene in their search. Police cordoned off buildings that were destroyed or are at risk of collapsing.  Nearby, one man stands close to tears. In the night of the earthquake, he and his family had tried to flee from their multistory home. But as they made their way out, the ceiling gave away and his wife and son fell three stories. They have been missing ever since. Emergency services were quick to help  Artur Bushi, the mayor of Kruja district, which was worst affected by the earthquake, coordinates the rescue operations, organizing aid, providing basic necessities and accommodation for those in need.  ""Saving human lives obviously has number one priority for us right now,"" Bushi told DW.  Once the first tremor hit, local authorities instantly came together to provide help, he said, adding, ""We immediately received help from the capital, Tirana, and a lot of assistance from neighboring countries. There is great solidarity."" Ditjon Kurti, a Red Cross staff member, said that after the earthquake struck, rescue workers from across the region streamed into Albania.  ""We will do everything to save these people and will stay here until all the rubble is cleared away,"" Kurti said.  'We are in shock, and our children keep shivering'  The first emergency shelters have been set up on Thumane's football pitch. The Torocino family has moved into one of the tents. The family of four used to live on the top floor of a high-rise. But the building collapsed, reduced to a pile of rubble. Emergency services are still sifting through the wreckage trying to find survivors. ""We are in shock, and our children keep shivering,"" Ibije Torocini said, adding that the quake and building's swaying woke the family. ""Me and my husband grabbed the children and bolted for the door — but it was blocked by the wardrobe that had moved because of the tremors. We heard a loud noise and saw the water tank crashing through the concrete ceiling and smash into our living room.""  They managed to open the door and flee the building, running for their lives. ""Minutes after reaching safety, the building collapsed,"" she said. The Toci family were lucky to survive, too.  ""Feeling everything sway was horrible,"" Klevis Toci said. ""My family managed to get out of the building when the earth was still trembling.""  He said many of their neighbors did not get out in time and he prays they are still alive.  Wave of solidarity  There have been about 300 aftershocks. Mayor Bushi said the government wants to strike agreements with hotels in the nearby towns of Lezha and Durres to put up people who've lost their homes.  Albanians and people around the world have donated money, clothes and food. Albania's neighbors have expressed solidarity, and many states have sent help. On Wednesday, Albania and Kosovo observed a day of national mourning."
2019-11-27,Death Toll in Albania's Earthquake Rises to 35 – Reports,Sputnik News Service,https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/263218028/death-toll-in-albania-earthquake-rises-to-35,"The death toll from a powerful earthquake that struck near the Albanian capital of Tirana has risen to 35, media reported on Wednesday. The 6.4 magnitude earthquake took place in the early hours of Tuesday and was followed by several powerful aftershocks​​​. The disaster caused significant destruction, especially in the city of Durres. According to the Albanian Daily News newspaper, hundreds of people were injured, 47 rescued from the debris and 25 more remain missing. The search and rescue operation is underway. Albania lies in a seismologically active region as the Mediterranean Sea is a border between the African and Eurasian plates. The movement of the African plate to the north – where the Eurasian plate lies – sometimes causes earthquakes and has already resulted in the formation of several mountain ranges in Europe, including the Alps. The deadliest earthquake in Albania took place on November 26, 1920, in the Gjirokaster County, leaving some 200 people dead."
2019-11-27,Albania Earthquake Kills at Least 23,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/world/europe/albania-earthquake-tirana.html,"Rescuers in Albania dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings in search of survivors on Tuesday, after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the Balkan nation, killing at least 23 people and injuring 650.  Using everything from earth-moving equipment to their bare hands, local residents and emergency crews in cities across the country had pulled 45 people alive from under mounds of debris by the evening, the government said. Thirty people were hospitalized.  The deadly quake was the strongest to hit Albania in decades, in a region known for its devastating temblors, and came just two months after the country was struck by another strong quake that damaged hundred of homes. Across the country, buildings crumbled, fallen facades left structures ripped open to the elements, and many others had ominous cracks snaking across their walls. In Durres, a hard-hit coastal city, the seven-story Vila Palma hotel collapsed, crushing cars parked underneath, but there was no immediate word on casualties. Many buildings on the outskirts of the city were also destroyed, raining concrete and bricks onto streets, vehicles and gardens.  “What we are seeing now is a very strong, very powerful sequence of earthquakes,” said Jadranka Mihaljevic, the head of engineering in the seismology department of the Institute for Hydrometeorology and Seismology in neighboring Montenegro, where she said the earthquake was felt across the country. The earthquake struck at 3:54 a.m. near the Adriatic coast, about 19 miles west of Tirana, home to nearly 900,000 people.  A resident of Tirana, George-Ilias Belidis, was sleeping in his apartment when a powerful, seemingly interminable tremor jolted him awake, and he said he thought his end had come.  “Everything was moving in an unbelievable rhythm, I could hear the walls cracking, dishes and glass breaking,” Mr. Belidis, a 24-year-old Greek citizen, said by phone a few hours after experienced the deadly quake “in all its rage.”  Videos and pictures shared on social media showed chaotic scenes of residents rummaging through the rubble, or trying to extricate people trapped under collapsed buildings. In one video, a group of people in Durres struggled in darkness to extract a young boy who was trapped in the wreckage crying out in pain.  In Elbasan, a town about 35 miles from Durres, Olsi Shehi, a 39-year-old cook, said a four-story house had fallen, trapping people inside. “I could hear six people screaming to get them out,” he said.  Albania’s president, Ilir Meta, described the situation “dramatic” as he visited Thumane, the town closest to the epicenter, where several people died. “We hope to overcome it with the least loss,” he wrote in a post on Twitter that included pictures of him talking with local people and an army officer. In a statement, Mr. Meta vowed that rescuers would “save every human life under the rubble of buildings” and help the injured. It was unclear how many people were still trapped, but locals worried the death toll could rise considerably.  As many as 1.2 million people may have faced “strong” and “very strong” shaking, according to the United States Geological Survey. Seismologists said that the quake and its aftershocks were felt in neighboring Montenegro, in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in southern Italy. Hours later, a 5.4-magnitude quake struck southern Bosnia and Herzegovina; there were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities.  On Sept. 21, a 5.6-magnitude quake in Albania injured dozens of people and damaged hundreds of homes in the same area hit on Tuesday. Officials and seismologists said that quake was the strongest to strike the country in 30 years.  Ms. Mihaljevic said the stability of the buildings in Albania might have been greatly compromised by the previous earthquake, and that their fragile state could lead to increased fatalities.  As the Albanian authorities requested international help, Montenegro and Serbia sent support and rescue teams, according to Prime Minister Edi Rama, who added that various leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, were preparing to help.  Emergency teams from Kosovo, Romania, Italy and Greece joined the effort, and European Union officials said they had reached out to Albania’s government to offer assistance. Countries in the Balkans and in southern Europe have a long history of destructive earthquakes. In 1999, a 7.6-magnitude quake killed 17,000 people in Turkey; and in 2016, more than 241 people died in a 6.2-magnitude quake in central Italy, seven years after the deadly Abruzzo earthquake that left more than 300 people dead.  A series of quakes also ravaged the region in the late 1970s, killing more than 1,500 people in Romania in 1977, dozens in Greece in 1978, and hundreds in 1979 in what was then Yugoslavia.  “The deadly 1977-1979 series was followed by a quiet period where new seismic energy was accumulating,” Ms. Mihaljevic said. “But after 40 years of relatively calm seismicity, strong quakes seem to be back.”  Many residents who rushed out of their houses in Tirana or Durres in the early hours of Tuesday, only to face numerous aftershocks in the open air.  Mr. Belidis, the 24-year-old Tirana resident, said he didn't know where he would live, describing his apartment as “uninhabitable.”  Even in houses and buildings that were still standing, the quake left walls bulging, and their inhabitants, most of whom remained outside even after the earthquake ended, terrified.  “Some were on the street, others in their cars,” said Mr. Shehi, in Durres. “You look around and you think, ‘We’re lucky we’re alive.’ ”  "
2019-11-27,'Everything We Have Is Destroyed': Albania Mourns After Deadly Earthquake,NPR,https://www.npr.org/2019/11/27/783286554/everything-we-have-is-destroyed-albania-mourns-after-deadly-earthquake,"Across Albania, survivors of Tuesday's earthquake are combing the wreckage of homes and buildings and seeking signs of life in the rubble. Amid the flotsam of cratered neighborhoods and improvised tent cities, Albanians are observing a national day of mourning Wednesday for those they lost — and hoping that those still missing won't soon be counted among the dead.  At least 31 people reportedly have been killed, according to the Albanian Red Cross, and hundreds more have been injured. It is the deadliest earthquake to hit the country since 1979, when a 6.9 magnitude earthquake left more than 120 people dead in Albania and across the border in the former Yugoslavia. A day of mourning was also observed Wednesday in Kosovo, whose foreign affairs minister, Behgjet Pacolli, announced that two Kosovar brothers were among the victims. In the Albanian cities of Thumane and Durres, the two cities hardest hit by the 6.4 magnitude quake, teams of rescuers deployed dogs, drones and heavy equipment to try to find survivors and pry them free. Rescue workers from more than a dozen countries have joined the efforts — including Serbia, Italy, Turkey and many others from Albania's Balkan neighbors. However, the operations were complicated by a series of sizable aftershocks that struck Wednesday just off-coast in the Adriatic Sea — one of which was large enough to cause authorities to call a pause to their work for their own safety.  Roughly 2,500 people in Albania have been displaced by the quake, and hundreds have gathered in makeshift camps and cars, while others have assembled inside a soccer stadium in Durres. Still others have holed up in hotels in the capital, Tirana. In a country that has the lowest gross domestic product per capital in Europe, per the International Monetary Fund, these losses threaten to leave survivors in desperate straits.  ""The quake left us without shelter,"" one survivor from Thumane told The Associated Press. ""Everything we have is destroyed: the apartment, windows, everything, and we cannot live there anymore.""  It is the second major earthquake in the past three months to strike Albania. Back in September, a 5.6 magnitude earthquake hit the country's central region, near Tirana, though no one was killed. Dozens were injured, however, and several buildings collapsed in some towns. "

Italian rescue teams were trying on Wednesday to save six family members, including twin toddlers, trapped under rubble when their house collapsed after Albania's worst earthquake in decades.  The death toll from Tuesday's quake rose to 30 as rescue workers dug through the remains of the four-storey house in the Adriatic port city of Durres.  Nine members of the Lala family were initially trapped but a boy of 17 was pulled out alive on Tuesday and the bodies of a 79-year-old woman and an eight-year-old girl have been recovered.  The rescue workers, watched by relatives and the twins' father, believe two girls aged 18 months, two boys of six and seven, a 16-year-old girl and a disabled man of 52 are still under the rubble.  Teams of soldiers, police and emergency workers sifted through the debris of shredded apartment blocks and hotels in towns near Albania's northwest Adriatic coast, close to the epicentre of the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that rattled the country."

The latest quake struck at 16:45 CET, 19km southwest of Mamurras — close to the coastal city of Durres that was worst-hit by Tuesday's devastation — according to preliminary data from the USGS.  It came after Prime Minister Edi Rama said authorities were working to match spare hotel rooms to thousands of survivors left homeless.  ""It is winter time, they can not stay under tents ... kids need to do their homework, people need to be warm and so on,"" he said during a visit to the coastal city of Durres, warning that it was ""not something we can do like that,"" snapping his fingers.  As Albania marked a national day of mourning for Tuesday's magnitude-6.1 earthquake, recovery efforts were continuing in the rubble of collapsed buildings.  Some 4,000 rescue workers, including paramedics and military police, were involved in search and rescue.  Many Albanians who lost their homes slept in hundreds of tents laid out in gyms, sports fields and stadiums.

One video broadcast live from Fushë-Krujë, in Durres county, showed a child screaming as rescuers tried to pull him from the rubble of what appeared to be a collapsed building.  Speaking to Euronews from Tirana, developer Silver Turku said he had rushed outside his home after the quake and later saw a vehicle that had burst into flames. ""I was home and working as a freelancer and it was strong and lasted for about less than a minute,"" he said.  ""After the earthquake, everybody in my in my neighbourhood got outside and we were making sure everyone was okay and needed help.  Turku said he had started filming his video around 10-15 minutes after the earthquake as emergency services fought to extinguish the fire.  ""I don't know for sure why it was set on fire but people were saying that a spark in electricity might have happened after the alarm had set off,"" he added.  ""It's a good thing that I was awake and went straight outside,"" he said. ""But you feel powerless and hope for the best in these situations."" According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake hit at 4 a.m. local time with the epicentre located 10km northwest of Shijak.  It also struck at a shallow depth of 10km.  ""What makes an earthquake deadly are the buildings that fall on people,"" seismologist Paul Earle from USGS told Euronews Tonight, adding that an earthquake of this magnitude could cause significant damage in any area.  ""This region seems especially hard-hit in those structures that are vulnerable to earthquake shaking"" such as ""non-ductile concrete-frame buildings and brick buildings"" based on images coming from the country.  In Durres, local lawyer Domenika Gjeci initially said on Facebook the lighting had been cut in her home and she was listening to ambulance sirens passing by.  ""Wish there is no damage to life,"" she wrote.  She later ventured out into the street and posted footage that she said showed the rubble of what was previously a three-storey market just 400m from her home. ""The earthquake has not stopped in Durres. God help people and those who are working in damaged buildings,"" she wrote about feeling further tremors, before adding: ""Another one just fell.""  Meanwhile, the EU said it was ""ready to offer assistance"" in the wake of the incident, and offered condolences to the victims.

""All of Europe stands in solidarity with the country and its people. Our thoughts go to the victims and their loved ones."" "
2019-11-27,Search teams race to find Albania earthquake survivors,PBS,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/search-teams-race-to-find-albania-earthquake-survivors,"Stopping at intervals to listen for the sounds of survivors, local and international rescue crews searched through the rubble of collapsed buildings Wednesday, a day after a deadly earthquake in Albania killed at least 26 people and injured more than 650.  Among those desperate for news was police officer Ajet Peci, who managed to emerge from the ruins of an apartment block that collapsed in the port city of Durres, killing his two adult daughters. His wife is still missing.  “How can I live?” Peci said, sobbing as he was consoled by neighbors, a bandage under his right eye and on a finger of his left hand. “I don’t know what I did to make it out. I wish I had stayed with them.”  Neighbors said only about four or five families were living in the five-story building at the time of the quake, as the owners of some of the apartments had emigrated.  Overnight, authorities said four more people had been confirmed dead, and one more death was reported early Wednesday afternoon, raising the death toll to 26, while more than 650 people were injured in the magnitude-6.4 quake that struck the country’s coastal cities.  In Durres, Albania’s second largest city, on the Adriatic Sea, residents slept in tents and cars and at a soccer stadium as powerful aftershocks from the earthquake continued. Others spent the night on open ground, huddling around fires to stay warm.  Rescuers continued to comb the rubble of a four-story villa that housed an extended family, looking for potential survivors. Locals said they believed about six people might still be in the collapsed structure.  Flags were flying at half-staff on public buildings around the country Wednesday as Albania observed a national day of mourning.  Prime Minister Edi Rama thanked neighbor Greece and other countries offering support.  “We feel good to not be alone, and I’m very grateful to all our friends,” Rama said late Tuesday, visiting Durres with Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias.  Rescue teams and other disaster experts arrived from more than a dozen countries including France, Italy, Greece, Romania, Turkey, Serbia, and the United States.  In the nearby town of Thumane, Kristina Margjini also spent the night outdoors.  “The quake left us without shelter. Everything we have is destroyed: The apartment, windows, everything, and we cannot live there anymore,” she said.  The quake in Albania Tuesday was followed by a smaller one in nearby southern Bosnia and a 6.1 magnitude temblor Wednesday off the coast of the island of Crete in Greece. No significant damage or injuries were reported from either quake."
2019-11-27,Rescuers try to save trapped toddlers as Albania quake toll hits 30,Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-albania-quake/rescuers-try-to-save-trapped-toddlers-as-albania-quake-toll-hits-30-idUSKBN1Y10OP,"Italian rescue teams were trying on Wednesday to save six family members, including twin toddlers, trapped under rubble when their house collapsed after Albania’s worst earthquake in decades. The death toll from Tuesday’s quake rose to 30 as rescue workers dug through the remains of the four-storey house in the Adriatic port city of Durres.  Nine members of the Lala family were initially trapped but a boy of 17 was pulled out alive on Tuesday and the bodies of a 79-year-old woman and an eight-year-old girl have been recovered.  The rescue workers, watched by relatives and the twins’ father, believe two girls aged 18 months, two boys of six and seven, a 16-year-old girl and a disabled man of 52 are still under the rubble.  In addition to the 30 dead across the country, the Defence Ministry said 650 people had been injured and 20 were missing.  If the death toll continues to rise, the earthquake could be more deadly than one in 1979 when 40 people were killed.  The quake, centered 30 km (19 miles) west of the capital Tirana, was felt across the Balkans and in the southern Italian region of Puglia, on the other side of the Adriatic Sea from Albania.  A 5.3 magnitude quake also struck just off Albania’s coast on Wednesday afternoon 38 km from Tirana, causing cracks to a high-rise apartment building in a main street in the capital. Residents fled and police cordoned off the area.  In the town of Thumane, close to the center of Tuesday’s 6.4 magnitude quake, rescuers used drones and dogs in search for survivors.  Temperatures in Albania were expected to remain well above 10 degrees Celsius (50°F) in the coming days but rain forecast for Thursday could hamper the rescue efforts.  Located along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas between Greece and Montenegro, Albania is prone to seismic activity. A quake measuring 6.0 also jolted the Greek island of Crete on Wednesday though no damage or injuries were reported.  DONOR CONFERENCE Albania was shaken by at least 250 aftershocks - three of them magnitude 5 - from Tuesday to Wednesday. Hundreds of people spent the night sleeping in tents pitched by the emergency services.  Italy, France, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and Serbia have sent 200 specialized troops, tools and teams of tracker dogs to help the relief effort.  The government declared Wednesday a day of mourning and Prime Minister Edi Rama said the authorities would rehouse people who had lost their homes in hotels during the winter.  “I believe we shall put them in new houses in 2020, in better housing than they had,” Rama said in a televised comment.  He said a donor conference with Turkey and regional countries would be organized and he would discuss potential help with NATO allies during next week’s summit in London. Albania is the poorest country in Europe, with per capita income a quarter of the European Union average, according to the International Monetary Fund.  In Thumane, a man called Adrian Muci said six of his relatives had been killed and his own house was on the point of collapse.  “I have other cousins and relatives but I don’t know where they are and if they are dead or not,” he told Reuters. “I will never be able to live in my house any more.”"
