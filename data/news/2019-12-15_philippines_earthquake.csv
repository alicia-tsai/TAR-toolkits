Yahoo.com,Rescuers search building rubble after Philippines earthquake,https://news.yahoo.com/rescuers-search-building-rubble-philippines-015707898.html,2019-12-16,"Rescuers pulled out two bodies Monday from a three-story building that collapsed in a strong earthquake in the southern Philippines and scrambled to find at least seven more people who were trapped inside.  Army troops, police, firefighters and volunteers, armed with sound and motion detectors, located a third body in the rubble of the building in Davao del Sur province’s Padada town but could not immediately extricate the remains pinned in slabs of cement, Padada Mayor Pedro Caminero said.  At least five people died in Sunday’s magnitude 6.9 quake that struck Padada and outlying rural towns, cities and provinces in a region that has been battered by three deadly earthquakes in recent months. A child died after being hit by a collapsed wall in her house and a woman in her 70s died from a heart attack during the quake, officials said.  “We’re looking for about seven more,” Caminero said by phone from Padada.  Distraught relatives waited in a cordoned area as rescuers worked overnight in search of their relatives.  Several shoppers managed to dash out of the building, which housed a grocery store, as the ground shook, including a number who were escorted out with injuries.  A total of 84 people were injured in the quake, officials said.  A city and four towns near the quake’s epicenter were still without power Monday, and classes were canceled in a broad area to give time for inspections of school buildings.  The Davao region has been hit by at least three powerful earthquakes in recent months, causing several deaths and scores of injuries and badly damaging houses, town halls, hotels, malls and hospitals.  The Philippine archipelago lies on the so-called Pacific “Ring of fire,” an arc of faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's earthquakes occur. It’s also lashed by about 20 typhoons and other severe storms each year, making the Southeast Asian nation of more than 100 million people one of the world's most disaster-prone countries."
Independent,Philippines earthquake: Powerful 6.9-magnitude quake strikes near Davao city,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/philippines-earthquake-today-tsunami-damage-latest-magnitude-usgs-deaths-a9247381.html,2019-12-15,"One child reported to have died and at least 14 injured as locals flee homes and shopping centres in panic, three-storey building collapses and power lines seen erupting in sparks. A powerful earthquake measuring 6.8-magnitude has struck the Philippines near the city of Davao, with one child reported to have died and 14 people been injured as tremors sent locals fleeing in panic from damaged homes and shopping centres.  The quake was centred 38 miles southwest of Davao on the island of Mindanao, at a depth of 28.2km, the US Geological Survey said, revising down the magnitude from an earlier reported 6.9.  Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of Matanao town in Davao del Sur province, told Radio DZMM that a six-year-old girl had died after a wall collapsed on her.  Speaking from an emergency shelter, Fernandez said his two-storey town hall had been badly damaged by the intense shaking, along with two bridges and several buildings already weakened by previous quakes.  ""The shaking was different this time, it wasn't swaying. It's like a roller was rumbling by underneath,"" he added, before appealing for food packages and tents to be sent out.  Anthony Allada, public information officer of Magsaysay Town in the province, said none of those hurt were seriously wounded. Roads and buildings, including the local government office, were damaged and power was out in the town, he said.  “We don’t know what to do anymore. Do we respond first or attend to our families first?”, Allada told the same station.  President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from Davao, was in the city when the quake struck.  “He is ok. He and his daughter Kitty were in their house when the quake struck,” presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said. “First Lady Honeylet was on her way home when the ground trembled. She said her car was swaying. She is unhurt.”  Ricardo Jalad, who heads the Office of Civil Defence, said his department had been notified that a three-story building collapsed in Padada as the ground shook and that authorities were checking if people got trapped inside. The building housed a grocery store, he said. Officials in Davao and Cotabato are checking the stability of school buildings and have suspended classes on Monday as a precaution.  The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) warned further damage from aftershocks could be expected. Two strong aftershocks of magnitude 5 and 5.7 centred north of General Santos City have already been recorded since the main tremor.   The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the quake.  DZMM reported power was also out in General Santos City, where patients at a local hospital were being evacuated.  Video footage of the latest quake posted on Twitter showed overhead electrical wires swaying and erupting in a shower of sparks. Another video showed water sloshing out of a residential swimming pool. One picture said to be from Padada, close to the epicentre in the province of Davao del Sur, showed a building collapsed onto a car and another people being rescued from beneath fallen rubble. The Philippines sits on the geologically active Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences frequent tremors, including four strong quakes in October and November, which together killed at least 20 people."

Vincent Fernandez, mayor of the town of Matanao, told local radio that a 6-year-old girl died after a wall collapsed on her during the powerful earthquake.  The US Geological Survey said the quake’s epicenter was near the town of Magsaysay in the populated province of Davao del Sur on Mindanao island. A second quake, of magnitude 5.7, followed soon afterward.  The initial earthquake was the third of magnitude 6.5 or higher to hit the area, southwest of Davao City, since late October. Those two earlier quakes, which struck over three days, as well as two others in October and November, left more than 20 people dead.  Because of its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions caused by the movement of tectonic plates.  On Sunday, the Philippine Information Agency reported that shoppers and employees were believed to be trapped inside a collapsed store in the town of Padada.  Flower vendors at a market in Padada were also trapped by a collapsed wall, according to a local radio station. Photographs on social media showed several people trying to extricate them.  Other photos showed damaged buildings and cracked roads.  “It was so strong; the house shook and swayed. We immediately rushed out,” said Aldrin Tumanda, a hotel worker in the area. “It felt as strong” as the previous earthquakes, he added.  He said neighbors in his community also rushed out of their homes, but returned after several minutes."
Dw.com,Major earthquake hits southern Philippines,https://www.dw.com/en/strong-earthquake-hits-southern-philippines/a-50545320,2019-12-15,"A major earthquake hit the southern Philippines, killing at least five people and damaging buildings already weakened by deadly tremors in October. Rescue efforts were disrupted by aftershocks. A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit the southern Philippines on Sunday, striking 61 kilometers (38 miles) southwest of the coastal city of Davao, at a depth of 28.2 kilometers.   Rescuers pulled out two bodies Monday from a three-story building that collapsed in Davao del Sur's city of Padada. A third body could not be immediately extricated from the rubble due to remains trapped in slabs of cement, according to Pedro Caminero, the town mayor.  The search continues for at least seven people who are believed to be still trapped inside the building.   A total of 84 people were injured in the earthquake, officials said.  The building housed a grocery store, with some shoppers managing to flee as the ground shook. Several people were escorted out by rescuers with injuries.  Strong aftershocks  Rescuers were forced to temporarily halt their efforts on Sunday, said local police commander Alberto Lupaz.  ""They (rescuers) were attempting to check the rubble... the aftershocks were too strong,"" Lupaz said.  A 6-year-old girl died when the building she was in collapsed on her in the town of Matanao.  A woman in her 70s died from a heart attack during the earthquake, officials said.   Matanao Mayor Vincent Fernandez said that the local town hall was badly damaged, along with two bridges and several buildings already weakened by previous quakes.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no threat of a tsunami.   The epicenter of the tremor was south of the populous city of Davao on the southern island of Mindanao, the same island that was struck by a series of deadly quakes in October, which left at least five dead.   The Mindanao region, which covers a third of the Philippines, is home to around 22 million people.  The Philippines is located on the ""Ring of Fire,"" a geologically active area that is regularly hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. "
Yahoo.com,Child killed as quake strikes southern Philippines,https://news.yahoo.com/strong-quake-hits-southern-philippines-damage-reported-091046309.html,2019-12-15,"Sunday's tremor cracked schools, toppled homes and injured dozens but largely spared big cities on the island of Mindanao. A powerful earthquake hit the southern Philippine island of Mindanao on Sunday, killing a child, injuring dozens and damaging buildings in an area still recovering from a string of deadly quakes in October.  Police said a rescue operation had been launched at a heavily damaged market building in Padada near the 6.8 magnitude quake's epicentre, which is about 90 kilometres (55 miles) south of the major city of Davao.  Patients were evacuated from hospitals as a precaution and nervous crowds massed outside shopping malls after the jolt and dozens of smaller, but strong aftershocks.  ""We can no longer use our office because the walls cracked and the stairs collapsed,"" local police spokeswoman Lea Orbuda told AFP. ""The power is off and the water taps are dry.""  A provincial police commander said the number of injured across the hardest hit areas had reached 62, with one confirmed fatality after a child was crushed under a collapsed structure.  The commander, Alberto Lupaz, said there appeared to be some people trapped under the damaged market building but rescue efforts had been delayed.  ""They (rescuers) were attempting to check the rubble... the aftershocks were too strong,"" Lupaz said.  President Rodrigo Duterte, who is from Davao, was caught up in the earthquake but was unharmed, officials said.  ""The First Lady... said the car she was riding (in) was swaying,"" spokesman Salvador Panelo said. ""They are unhurt.""  There was no threat of a tsunami, said the US Geological Survey, which initially reported the magnitude at 6.9.  The Philippines is situated on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.  Three quakes above 6.0 magnitude hit roughly the same area of Mindanao in a matter of weeks in October, killing some two dozen people and heavily damaging office buildings, schools and apartments.  Tens of thousands of people were forced into shelters by the string of tremors, the government said, either because their homes were damaged or they were too afraid to return.  Most of the deaths in October were due to collapsing walls and falling debris, including a teenage boy who was crushed by a falling wall as he tried to escape his school.  Other fatalities were attributed to rock and landslides unleashed by the violent shaking that injured at least 400 people.  The Philippines has been hit by several very powerful earthquakes in recent decades, including one of magnitude 7.8 that struck the northern resort town of Baguio in 1990.  That tremor toppled multi-story buildings and hotels, killing some 1,200 people."

Douglas Cagas said a three-story building housing a grocery store collapsed in downtown Padada during the quake, trapping an unspecified number of people inside. Search and rescue efforts were underway, he told the DZMM radio network, adding that an unknown number of people were injured in his province.  Matanao Mayor Vincent Fernandez said his two-story town hall was badly damaged by the intense shaking, along with two bridges and several buildings already weakened by previous quakes.  “The shaking was different this time, it wasn’t swaying. It’s like a roller was rumbling by underneath,” Fernandez told DZMM from an emergency shelter. As he was being interviewed, he paused briefly, saying the ground was shaking again in the latest of dozens of aftershocks.  Fernandez appealed for food packs and tents to be used by residents who needed immediate shelter from the rainy weather. Many buildings that can be used as evacuation centers have been damaged by recent earthquakes, he said.  President Rodrigo Duterte was safe with his daughter in his house in Davao city, where the earthquake was felt strongly. He returned to sleep after the tremors, said Brig. Gen. Jose Niembra, who heads the presidential security force.  Classes in Davao del Sur province will be suspended Monday to allow checks on the stability of school buildings.

The girl was inside her family's house when the building collapsed and killed her, the province's governor, Douglas Cagas, told CNN. The quake struck the island of Mindanao and its largest city, Davao. Fire Service director Chief Superintendent Samuel Tadeo confirmed the three deaths and said a market in Padada had collapsed. The country's second-largest island is a popular tourist destination, and videos posted on social media showed hotel pools dramatically overflowing and mass evacuations of shoppers from malls. Residents reported schools had been severely damaged -- luckily empty of students at the time, as the quake happened on a Sunday. Gov. Cagas of the island's Davao del Sur province said a three-story building had collapsed. Classes have been suspended for Monday, and bridges closed due to cracks, Davao city officials said. President Rodrigo Duterte was at his home in Davao, the largest city on the island, at the time of the quake, reported state-run Philippine News Agency (PNA). He was unhurt, although his house reportedly ""sustained several cracks in the walls."" There were several aftershocks in nearby provinces, including a 5.0 magnitude, according to the US Geological Survey. It added that there was no tsunami threat, as the quake struck inland and not the water. It's the latest in a serious of quakes to strike the island in recent months. In October another series of 6.6 and 6.5-magnitude quakes struck Mindanao, killing 14 and injuring more than 400."
