Test results regarding global responses were investigated in this chapter. Before the main tests, the pullback and free vibration tests were conducted to determine the initial lateral stiffness and period of each specimen. SP1 was stiffer than SP2 by about 50%, and had a shorter lateral period than SP2 by 8.5%. The rationale for not having the ratio of stiffness equal to the square of the ratio of period was because the tested column represented a 2DOF system in the lateral direction, with coupling between the translational and rotational modes. During the low-intensity excitations, the periods of both specimens became close to each other. Based on this observation, it is speculated that SP2 experienced some cracking before the tests.
Shaking table flexibility had a pronounced effect on the vertical response. The dynamic mode that was introduced by the table stiffness (in the vertical direction) and table mass governed the response in the vertical direction; therefore, response due to the column’s dynamic mode was pronounced much less compared to the case of a rigid shaking table.
The acceleration recorded on the mass in the X-direction had a low frequency content and low amplitude compared to that at the top of the column or on the table which was due to the rigid body rotation of mass blocks. 
The maximum acceleration at the top of the column or on the mass blocks did not increase linearly with that on the table or the input intensity for two reasons First, the lateral stiffness of the column decreased with increasing level of intensity; second, the base shear capacity of the column was reached at the higher intensity levels. In contrast, the acceleration histories in the Z-direction were almost the same on the table, along the column height, and on top of the mass blocks. The maximum values linearly increased with the input intensity since axial forces were in the linear range and therefore axial stiffness variation was minor.
The force response was essential to the study since it is closely related to shear strength of the column. Similar to the accelerations, the maximum shear force did not increase linearly with the input intensity, but the maximum axial force did. The peak shear force in 125%-scale ‘X only’ test was larger than 125%-scale 1st or 2nd ‘X+Z’ test for each specimen, where the peak force was determined by the shear strength at this intensity. Considerable tensile force was induced on the test column due to vertical excitation. Tension in the columns is believed to result in degradation of shear strength, which is mainly due to the degradation of concrete contribution to shear strength.
Comparison of bending moment histories at the base and top of both of the specimens indicated that they were opposite in sign during the strong part of the excitation of all the intensity levels, suggesting that the columns were in double-curvature. Moments at the base and top were similar in sign after the strong part of the excitation ceased for all the tests. Note that three 125%-scale resulted in similar maximum moment values, suggesting that the axial force variation did not affect the bending moment noticeably.
The relative displacement histories captured the horizontal and vertical movement of each specimen. Displacement at the top was the largest in the X-direction at less than 2.0 in. The residual lateral displacement increased with the increased intensity of ground motions. The vertical displacement rarely went to the shortening side, and the residual vertical displacement kept increasing on the elongation side, implying that the column was elongated by the presence of horizontal and diagonal cracks. Damage detection after the tests indicated the presence of cracks consistent with the residual axial displacements. In addition, it was observed that 125%-scale ‘X only’ motion did not increase the residual vertical displacement.
The change of lateral stiffness is clearly shown in the shear force-lateral displacement relationship. From 95%-scale tests, the decrease in lateral stiffness had a directional difference, implying that the damage was not symmetric on the north and south. In the last 125%-scale test, stiffness in the positive direction was about 17% of that in 50%-scale test. In the axial force-vertical displacement relation, no significant decrease in stiffness was observed.
Flexural damage took place both at the top and base of the column as the scale of the ground motion increased, and flexural damage at the top of the column occurred before that at the base since the moment at the top was larger. This was a result of the large mass moment of inertia at the top of the column. Reduction of the acceleration on the mass block due to the rotations contributed to this situation as well. As a result of flexural yielding both at the top and bottom of the column in double curvature, the shear force reached shear capacity, which would not take place if yielding was occurring at the bottom and the moment at the top was smaller than the yield moment; therefore, shear cracks occurred.
The progress of shear failure was visible in crack patterns. Both specimens started to experience diagonal cracks near h = 50~65 in. on the east and west sides during 70%-scale tests. They spread over the over the east and west sides except h = 25~35 in. Also, there were vertical cracks as well as horizontal cracks on the north and south sides. SP2 had more cracks than SP1, since SP2 had wider hoop spacing. Note that the diagonal cracks did not appear during 125% ‘X only’ test as many as those in 125% ‘X+Z’ tests, supporting the observation that the concrete contribution to shear strength was reduced due to the presence of axial tension.
Local responses were presented and discussed in this chapter. The curvature histories were calculated from the longitudinal strains on the north and south sides. The closest cross-sections to the base and the top were at h = 10 in. and 60 in., respectively. The comparison suggests that the column was in double curvature during the main excitation. The peak curvature at h = 60 in. was up to five times larger than that at h = 10 in. The initial tangent in moment-curvature relationship (M-φ) decreased as the intensity increased, especially at h = 60 in. In contrast, the initial tangent at h = 10 in. did not change significantly.
The longitudinal strain response was measured at the four reinforcing bars on the north, south, east, and west sides. A total of six cross sections were instrumented for the north and south direction, and three cross sections were instrumented for the east and west direction. As observed in the curvature responses, double-curvature was confirmed by the longitudinal strain on the north and south sides (since the phase angle between the time histories of the strain measurements was shifted along the height during the main excitation). The largest longitudinal strain was detected near the top of the column. This was followed by the value near the base. Finally the middle of the column had the smallest strain value. The effect of the 125%-scale ‘X only’ motion was not remarkably different from that of the ‘1st X+Z’ or ‘2nd X+Z’ runs. For the east and west sides, the abrupt change in tensile strain due to axial tension was remarkable. It was more significant than that on the north and south sides. The axial force significantly affected the strain histories on the east and west, and one of the peaks in each history appeared at the tension peak. The maximum tensile strain under 125%-scale motion decreased when the vertical (Z) component was not applied. A phase angle shift was also detected on the east and west sides.
The transverse strains on the north and south were measured at seven cross sections. Moreover, two cross sections at columns heights from the base of h = 10 in. and 35 in. had six and four gages around the hoop, respectively. The maximum transverse strain increased with repeated runs for most gages. Therefore, the effect of vertical excitation on transverse strains was not significant. Effect of shear was dominant on strains at h = 35 in., whereas bending moment-induced axial stresses and corresponding lateral stresses affected the strains more at h = 10 in.
Since existing elements in OpenSees are not suitable to incorporate the code-based shear strength estimation, two shear springs, which adopt the shear strength predictions by the ACI and SDC equations, were developed. The force-displacement relationship of the proposed springs is based on a bilinear envelope, which is defined by the initial stiffness, the yield force, and the hardening ratio for post-yield stiffness. Before yielding, the yield force is updated at each integration time step using the axial force and displacement ductility at that time step. At the time step where the demand reaches the capacity, yielding takes place and the force-displacement relationship follows the post-yield behavior. The yield force is not updated and kept constant afterwards unless the column is subjected to any value of axial tension in the case of the Caltrans SDC spring and a predetermined value of tension fin the case of the ACI spring. The yield force is kept constant after this final modification. Due to some unique features of the SDC equation, its shear strength is estimated as Vs, i.e., the shear resistance of concrete is completely ignored under axial tension.
Two types of computational models were utilized. Model A has a BWH element, and Model B had NLBC elements for the column. Each model considered columns without shear springs (A-1 and B-1) and with shear springs, designated as A-2-ACI, A-2-SDC, B-2-ACI, and B-2-SDC. For the input motion in X- and Y-directions, the acceleration histories recorded on the shaking table during 50% to 125%-scale tests were used. For the Z-direction, because of the flexibility of the shaking table, the axial force recorded by the load cells (after summation of all four values) was used instead of vertical acceleration. To maintain the dynamic equilibrium, negligible nodal mass was utilized for the Z-direction. The computational results were compared with those obtained from the tests.
The computational models containing BWH and NLBC elements provided similar results Both models were successful in capturing the shear force and lateral displacement history measured during the tests. They captured the rotational mode effect on the moment at the column top accurately. In shear force and bending moment, the amplitude of each response is generally in the following order: A-1>A-2-ACI>A-2-SDC (or B-1>B-2-ACI>B-2-SDC). The models without the shear springs did not capture the shear strength degradation accurately, whereas the models including ACI and SDC shear springs captured the shear strength degradation due to axial tension. Although both of the models incorporating springs provided results on the conservative side, the ACI shear spring predictions would safely be considered as accurate and SDC shear spring predictions as highly conservative. Note that all the models investigated in this chapter provided reasonable estimations for the lateral displacement response, but they did not for the vertical displacement response. As a result, local responses estimated by each model did not even come close to matching those obtained from the test results.
