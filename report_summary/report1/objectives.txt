The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of axial force produced by the vertical component of the ground motion on the behavior of bridge columns, especially on shear strength degradation. An outline of the research program is presented in Figure 1.1.
This study consisted of three parts. First, a bridge prototype is described, with the stated assumption that its shear demand changed under the existence of vertical acceleration. Also, a parametric study was conducted on a single column model, which is based on a representative bridge prototype. Using a sub-set of ground motions from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Centerâ€™s Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) ground motion database [2013], with strong influence of the vertical acceleration, the shear demand was compared to capacity suggested in current codes. The outline of specimen design and input candidates were determined based on the parametric study results.
Second, dynamic tests were designed and test results reported. The specimens, which were one-quarter-scale models of the prototype columns, were designed based on the Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria [2013]. Corresponding mass and mass moment of inertia were determined from the prototype. Fidelity tests were used to choose the most suitable motion that could be replicated by the shaking table at the Richmond Field Station, University of California, Berkeley (UCB). Dynamic tests of two specimens were conducted and the results imply that vertical acceleration has the potential to degrade the shear capacity of an RC bridge column. 
Third, a new OpenSees shear spring element was developed because existing elements do not reflect the ductility-axial-shear coupled behavior. Upon improved modeling, results from the specimen analysis were examined scrupulously, especially in terms of shear strength variation. Current code equations were evaluated and compared to the analysis results.
