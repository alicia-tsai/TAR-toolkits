Bridges constitute a major component of the transportation network. Partial or total collapse of bridges after earthquakes may lead to considerable interruption of emergency and recovery services. Reinforced concrete (RC) and prestressed concrete (PC) bridges, a vital component in transportation systems, were observed to have substandard performance during earthquakes, due to the inherent lack of redundancy of the structural system [Priestley et al. 1996]. Bridges and other parts of the transportation network have been constructed prior to recent advances in earthquake engineering in many parts of the world. In addition, bridges designed according to the modern codes have been severely damaged or collapsed in the earthquakes that have occurred within the last two decades in various parts of the world, including the United States, Japan, Taiwan, and others. Since bridge structures are not designed with enough redundancy and columns are the most critical part of the bridge structural system, their brittle failure should be prevented. Shear failure is one of the most critical brittle failure mechanisms and involves rapid strength degradation due to a complex shear mechanism related to increasing flexure-shear crack width. It is known that axial force or strain affects the shear capacity. As an example, near-fault vertical ground motions may lead to tensile forces on the bridge columns during short time intervals, leading to negligible contribution of concrete to shear capacity after cracking. Although the effect of axial force on shear capacity is an accepted fact, current seismic codes do not have a consensus on this effect, and different code equations might lead to different shear capacity estimations. On the demand side, axial forces that are not taken into consideration, such as those due to vertical excitation, may lead to an increase in the moment capacities, resulting in greater shear forces than expected.
