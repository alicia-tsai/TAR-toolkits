This chapter presents results of RHA and bearing force vs. displacement (hysteresis loops), and spectral responses of the Base Model bridge for each ground-motion group. Amplification of base shear in 3D motion (vertical and horizontal components) vs. ground-motion intensity are evaluated. Section 4.1 reports the various mode shapes and periods of the Base Model bridge to evaluate the behavior of the bridge under dynamic earthquake forces. Section 4.2 details various response histories, such as acceleration, shear force, displacement, and axial force, as well as bearing force-displacement for a representative motion selected from each of the three ground-motion groups. Section 4.3 reports peak shear force and acceleration responses for all selected ground motions. Section 4.4 examines in detail the spectral response of the Base Model bridge. This section demonstrates the existence of coupled horizontal and vertical modes, which are apparent in the deck spectra under combined horizontal and vertical shaking compared to horizontal shaking only.

Knowledge of the dynamic properties of the bridge is critical to evaluating its dynamic response, especially when the bridge is subjected to vertical shaking and potential horizontal–vertical coupling. An eigenvalue analysis of the Base Model bridge was performed in OpenSees to identify the frequencies and mode shapes of the participating modes. Also, a corresponding stick model of the bridge was built in SAP2000 [CSI 2017] and modal analysis performed for validation. Mode shapes and periods determined from each software were similar. The results shown here are from the OpenSees model. For modal analysis, the TPB models were replaced by linear springs with an effective stiffness representative of large displacement response. For this analysis, the effective period Teff was assumed to be 3 sec. Isolators at bent and abutment locations carry different axial forces based on tributary area, and the effective stiffnesses, keff, of individual isolators were calculated according to the following equation:

where miso is the mass carried by the isolator.
The first ten modes shapes and corresponding periods are shown in Figure 4.1. The periods and corresponding modal mass participation factors in each direction are tabulated in Table 4.1. This information allows interpretation of the modal responses. The first three modes are isolation modes, which means the bridge deck moves as a single rigid mass sliding on the isolators. These three modes represent movement in the longitudinal, transverse, and torsional directions, respectively. Mode 4 is a first vertical mode, and Mode 5 is a second vertical mode. Mode 6 is a second transverse mode that activates significant bending of the deck about the vertical axis. Mode 7 is a vertical superstructure deformation mode (3C-shape). Vertical Modes 4 and 5 exhibit deck displacements in different directions and low mass participation; see Table 4.1. In contrast, the deformations in vertical Mode 7 are in-phase, and the mode has high mass participation around 80%; thus it is likely to be expressed in the dynamic response more than the other vertical modes. Modes 8 and 10 are rotational modes that rotate the deck in the clockwise direction, while Mode 9 is a deck torsional mode that rotates the deck in two different directions such that the deck twists.

Next, response history results are presented for the Base Model bridge incorporating the nonlinear TPB isolator element. The equations of motion were solved in OpenSees using Newmark’s average acceleration integrator and the Newton–Raphson line search algorithm. Results are shown for a representative motion from each ground-motion group. The effect of vertical motion is defined by the amplification ratio, AR, defined as

where is the peak response (over time) during a 3D motion, and  is the peak response during the comparable 2D motion, with the vertical input omitted. Simply put, AR is the ratio of peak responses during 3D motion and 2D motion.

The vertical components of Group 1 motions had the greatest effect on bridge response since they have high vertical intensity. The SFPU motion (PGAV = 0.817g) (Table 2.2) is selected as a representative motion from Group 1. Figure 4.2 shows the deck transverse and longitudinal direction acceleration histories at Bent 1. Peak accelerations are indicated by a circle and corresponding value for both 3D and 2D motions. The peak transverse direction accelerations during 3D and 2D motions are 0.35g and 0.14g, respectively. The peak longitudinal direction accelerations during 3D and 2D shaking are 0.21g and 0.11g, respectively. Thus, AR = 2.42 for transverse acceleration and 1.9 for longitudinal acceleration; see Equation (4.2). Accelerations under the 3D motion in both directions are affected by a high-frequency oscillation; as a result, the peak acceleration increases relative to the 2D motion. 
Figure 4.3 represents transverse- and longitudinal-direction shear force histories of a column at Bent 1. Again, circles and corresponding values indicate the peak shear force. Shear-force histories are almost identical to acceleration histories, suggesting that the deck acted as a single mass sliding on the isolators. For the transverse base shear, AR = 2.56, and for longitudinal base shear, AR = 1.83. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 suggest that high-frequency vertical oscillation was transferred to the acceleration and base shear during 3D motion, which increased the shear force demand on the bridge piers.

Figure 4.4 demonstrates Bent 1 column axial force history, vertical acceleration history, and longitudinal shear force history. Since TPB isolators do not have tension capacity, the isolator will experience uplift when they reach zero axial force. Uplift of the isolators occurs at approximately 3 sec, 3.2 sec, 6 sec, 6.3 sec, 8.5 sec, 9.3 sec, and 9.5 sec; see Figure 4.4(a). The uplift and subsequent pounding causes a spike in vertical acceleration, which is evident in Figure 4.4(b). Figure 4.4(c) illustrates a sudden increase in the shear force correlated to the uplift and spiked vertical acceleration.
Figure 4.5 compares the Bent 1 isolator displacement histories in each direction for 2D and 3D shaking due to SFPU ground motion. Unlike horizontal acceleration and base shear, vertical shaking has a minimal effect on isolator displacement. Figure 4.6 illustrates the total force-displacement hysteresis loops summed over all isolators for SFPU motion. When the bridge is subjected to 2D motion, the axial force variation is negligible [Figure 4.4(a)], and the isolator force-displacement loop is smooth; however, when the bridge is subjected to 3D motion, the axial force variation is high [Figure 4.4(a)], which causes a corresponding variation in the horizontal shear force. This results in local oscillation of the isolator force in the force-displacement loop and an overall increase in the peak base shear. The vertical component increases significantly the base shear. Thus omitting the vertical component may lead to underestimation of force demands.

The LPG motion (PGAV = 0.62g) was selected as a representative Group 2 ground motion. Group 2 motions have moderate vertical intensity; therefore, the AR is expected to be lower than Group 1 motions. Figure 4.7 presents horizontal acceleration histories in both directions for the LPG motion at Bent 1. Based on the observed peak accelerations, AR = 1.41 for the transverse acceleration and 1.18 for longitudinal direction acceleration. These amplifications are much less than the corresponding AR for Group 1 motion SFPU (2.7 for transverse acceleration and 1.9 for longitudinal acceleration). Overall, peak accelerations in the longitudinal and transverse directions during 2D motion are lower than exhibited by Group 1 (Figure 4.7 versus Figure 4.2) due to comparatively lower horizontal shaking intensities; during the 3D motion, they are lower due to comparatively lower PGAV.
Figure 4.8 plots the shear-force histories in the transverse and longitudinal directions for a column at Bent 1 of the bridge. The base-shear AR is 1.43 for the transverse direction and 1.21 for the longitudinal direction. Here, the AR for base shear is almost the same as the AR for deck acceleration. Figure 4.9 shows the axial force history of an isolator at Bent 1; uplift did not occur due to this moderate-intensity vertical motion. As a result, spikes in the vertical acceleration history (not shown here) are not present, which correlate to lower amplification of the horizontal acceleration and base shear in both directions.

Figure 4.10 shows the displacement history of a TPB isolator at Bent 1 during the LPG motion. Consistent with earlier findings, the isolator displacement is not affected by the vertical component of ground shaking. Figure 4.11 shows the total isolator force-displacement hysteresis loops summed over all isolators for the LPG motion. The effect of the axial force variation on the isolator shear force for 3D shaking is also evident in this figure, although not as pronounced as in Figure 4.6. Specifically, axial force variation in transverse direction is greater, and the hysteresis loop in transverse direction shows increased base shear compared to the longitudinal direction.

This section presents response histories to the IIB motion (PGAV = 0.38g) as a representative Group 3 motion. Motions from Group 3 have comparatively low vertical intensity. Figure 4.12 shows the horizontal acceleration histories for the IIB motion. The AR is 1.16 for the transverse direction acceleration and 1.42 for the longitudinal direction acceleration. Figure 4.13 shows the base-shear histories in the transverse and longitudinal directions in a column at Bent 1. The increase in acceleration for 3D motion is also reflected in base-shear histories; see Figure 4.13. The AR for transverse base shear is 1.22 and for longitudinal base shear is 1.42, which is almost the same as the AR for acceleration. Figure 4.14 displays the axial force history of a Bent 1 isolator. Similar to Group 2 (moderate-intensity) motions, no instances of isolator uplift during this motion are observed.
One notable difference in the response to this motion compared to the motions examined for Groups 1 and 2 is that the AR for longitudinal direction acceleration and base shear is higher than for the transverse direction. An inspection of the axial force history in Figure 4.14 shows that the peak axial force variation occurred around 5 sec. Thus, the timing of the strongest intensity vertical shaking is out-of-phase with the peak transverse direction acceleration [Figure 4.12(a)], but in-phase with the peak longitudinal direction acceleration [Figure 4.12(b)]. This implies that the AR is influenced by the relative phasing of horizontal and vertical shaking, and the peaks produced by horizontal and vertical shaking may not directly sum together.

Figure 4.15 depicts the displacement histories of a Bent 1 isolator due to IIG motion. The vertical component has no effect on the displacement demands of the bridge as was observed for other motions. Figure 4.16 plots the total force-displacement summed over all isolators. The displacement demands are unaffected by vertical shaking, but the base shear in both directions is increased by the presence of the vertical ground acceleration.

This section discusses trends in peak acceleration, peak base shear, and their corresponding AR (Equation 4.2) for all selected motions. The differences in AR based on ground-motion intensity–distinguished by ground-motion group–are identified. Figure 4.17 plots the peak acceleration at Bent 1 during 2D shaking (orange dot) and 3D shaking (blue dot) for both transverse and longitudinal directions, and lists the value of the corresponding AR. Results are distinguished by the ground-motion group as indicated. Comparable results for base shear are presented in Figure 4.18; note that these values are for total base shear summed over all isolators, and thus some values differ slightly from those reported earlier. The AR for peak accelerations and total base shear are also tabulated in Table 4.2, which also shows the AR averaged over each ground-motion group.
Based on the presented results, the AR for total base shear are almost the same as for acceleration. An exception to this trend is in the transverse direction for Group 1 motions, where average AR for the base shear is notably higher than for acceleration. For Group 1 motions, the average acceleration AR are 2.55 and 1.84, and average base-shear AR are 2.55 and 2.02 in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively. Group 2 and 3 motions have similar average ARs for acceleration and base shear ranging from about 1.15 to 1.3. Clearly, the high vertical intensity Group 1 motions produced much higher ARs than the lower intensity Group 2 and 3 motions.

Acceleration response spectra of the total (absolute) deck acceleration histories as predicted by analysis in both the horizontal and vertical directions have been developed for representative motions. Peaks in these spectra are generally associated with the excited structural modes of the bridge. The spectral response for accelerations at Bent 1 in the longitudinal, transverse, and vertical directions due to the SFPU motion are plotted in Figure 4.19. These response spectra in the transverse and longitudinal direction exhibit peaks near 1.5 sec, which indicate the isolation mode in each direction. The period of these isolation modes is different from that computed in modal analysis, which utilized an effective stiffness that reflected the full displacement capacity of isolators; however, for many ground motions, the induced displacement demand is less than the capacity, resulting in a higher effective stiffness and lower effective period. For 3D relative to 2D shaking, amplification of the spectral acceleration is observed for shorter periods, which is likely controlled by the presence of a peak at about 0.2 sec for 3D shaking that is absent for 2D shaking. This peak is much stronger in the transverse direction than in the longitudinal direction. The vertical spectrum (3D motion only) exhibits grouped peaks from about 0.2 to 0.3 sec and several peaks at shorter periods. These short periods are likely associated with higher vertical modes, which have not been included in the eigenvalue analysis.
As noted above, differences in spectral response (especially in the transverse direction) are observed for 2D versus 3D shaking. To explore this further, Figure 4.21 plots the transverse direction deck spectra at three strategic locations (indicated by black dots): to the left of Bent 1, mid-span, and to the right of Bent 2. These locations to the left and right of the bents correspond to nodes in Mode 6 (the second transverse mode in Figure 4.1), which is superimposed over the undeformed bridge (Figure 4.20). The significance of these nodal locations is that Mode 6 peaks will not be visible in the response spectra at these locations even if this mode contributes meaningfully to the response. As seen in Figure 4.20, the spectral response for 2D shaking is the same at all locations, and Mode 6 is not expressed (no peak is visible at the modal period of 0.2 sec). For 3D shaking, Mode 6 is strongly expressed at the mid-span location, with a spectral acceleration peak of 0.86g at 0.2 sec. This more than doubles the peak acceleration observed at that location compared to the 2D shaking. This peak can be conclusively associated with Mode 6 since it does not appear at the Mode-6 node locations.
To understand why the second transverse mode is expressed in 3D shaking and not 2D shaking, the vertical spectra at various locations were examined. Figure 4.21 plots the vertical deck spectra at five locations: in the middle of each span and at the two bents. One factor common among all vertical modes in Figure 4.1 (Modes 4, 5, and 7) is that the modal displacement is large at mid-span and minimal at the bent locations. This modal pattern is replicated in the deck spectra in Figure 4.21, where spectral peaks are on the order of 15g at mid-span locations and 2–3g at bent locations. The peak is observed at a period near 0.2 sec and believed to correspond to Mode 7. Although Mode 7 does not have the longest period, it is dominant among the vertical modes due to its high modal participation factor (Table 4.1) as was projected earlier.

As discussed previously, vertical ground shaking leads to high-frequency variation in the axial forces on the TPBs. Since the bearing horizontal force (based on friction) is proportional to the axial force, high-frequency oscillation is also introduced to the bearing horizontal force and overall base shear; see Figures 4.3, 4.4, 4.9, and 4.14. From the results shown in Figures 4.20 and 4.21, the higher frequency oscillation introduced to the base shear occurs at a period around 0.2 sec, which happens to be closely matched to the period of the second transverse mode (Mode 6). As a result, the second transverse mode is excited for 3D shaking only due to the coupling of the closely spaced horizontal and vertical modes. For this example, the coupling is shown to greatly increase the peak horizontal acceleration in the bridge superstructure.
As discussed in the introduction, although the horizontal–vertical (H–V) coupling phenomenon has been observed in buildings, it was assumed to be an unlikely occurrence in bridges. This has been proven false as such coupling was identified in the first bridge model examined in this study. Since bridge superstructure acceleration does not specifically correlate to damage (unlike a building with a varied assortment of acceleration-sensitive components and equipment), bridge engineers might conclude that the amplification of acceleration is unimportant. This discussion points out that such coupling is possible. The responses under such coupling can only be predicted by 3D RHA, with mass finely distributed over the superstructure spans. Bridge engineers are recommended to apply such analysis approaches when deemed necessary.

As an example, sample calculations are tabulated for the Base Model bridge subjected to Group 1 motion SFPU. For excitation in the transverse direction, the peak isolator displacement was uo = 10.33 in., and base shear for 2D shaking was Vb,2D/W = 0.135. The isolator friction coefficient µ = 0.08, Reff = 120 in. (based on T = 3.5 sec), PGAV = 0.817g, and Sa(Tv)/PGAV = 1.98. Calculations for each value of ν are shown in Table 5.1.
The actual base-shear coefficient for 3D shaking simulation from RHA was . Thus, for this example, a lower amplification factor underestimates the amplification of the base shear, but including an amplification factor based on the vertical spectral response leads to a slightly conservative estimate of the base-shear amplification.

Figures 5.1 and 5.2 present the simulated base-shear coefficients for 2D and 3D motions, along with base-shear coefficient for 3D motions estimated with different amplification factors in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively. In the transverse direction, the estimated base-shear values are conservative for almost all motions, except for two Group 1 motions. These motions have high vertical acceleration intensity, which for SFPU was shown to lead to uplift and subsequent pounding on the isolators (Figure 4.4) that greatly increased the realized vertical acceleration and subsequent base shear. In such cases, the proposed approximations underestimated the base-shear coefficient for 3D shaking. For many motions, ν = 0.5 gives a very good estimate, while increasing the amplification factor leads to a more conservative estimate. In the longitudinal direction, the base shear is not as strongly affected by the vertical acceleration spikes, and the base-shear estimates are a little more conservative than in the transverse direction. Again, ν = 0.5 is often adequate, and ν = 1 is conservative for almost every ground motion in the longitudinal direction.

To evaluate the overall applicability of either proposed method to estimate the increase in base shear due to vertical shaking, a meaningful quantification of error is necessary. The methods presented in Section 5.1 attempted to estimate directly the increase or amplification in base shear for 3D shaking relative to 2D shaking. Therefore, a logical approach is to quantify directly the error in this estimated base-shear amplification relative to the actual base-shear amplification. Thus, an amplification error or AE, is proposed as:

Using the calculations for the Base Model bridge subjected to the SFPU motion in the transverse direction and assuming  (see Table 5.1), , , and  by Equations (5.8) and (5.9). Substituting theses values into Equation (5.10), , , and . The negative sign indicates that the base shear is underestimated. Values of AE for all three considered values of ν for this example are tabulated in Table 5.1.
Figures 5.3 and 5.4 present AE for all motions in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively, for all three values of amplification factor ν. The value of AE is generally positive for moderate- and low-intensity vertical motions except for ν = 0.5 for some ground motions. The value of AE is most likely to be negative for high-intensity vertical motions as the amplification estimate is unconservative. Using an amplification factor ν = 0.5 seems to produce an average AE closest to 0 (i.e., it minimizes the average error), but increases the likelihood that the estimate may be unconservative. All amplification estimates are conservative on average. Incorporating the spectral acceleration in the amplification factor increases the likelihood that the estimated base shear is very conservative.
Figure 5.4 illustrates instances of AE reaching more than 1000%, which would seem to imply that the proposed base-shear estimates are worthless; however, the AE measures the error only relative to the observed base-shear amplification, which may not give reasonable values when amplification of base shear due to vertical shaking is small. Evidence of this phenomenon is shown in Figure 5.2 for the LAL and IIS motions. The actual base-shear amplification from 2D to 3D motion [Δ in Equation (5.10)] is 0.0035 for the LAL motion and 0.005 for the IIS motion. Since the quantity to be estimated is near 0, the apparent AE is very large. This does not necessarily mean that the overall estimate of base-shear coefficient is unreasonable or unacceptable.
Another error estimation method is presented hereafter to avoid penalizing observations where the amplification in the base shear is low. The proposed base-shear normalized error or BSNE, directly quantifies the error in the total 3D estimated base-shear coefficient estimate relative to the base-shear coefficient determined from the simulations:

Using the values presented earlier for the SFPU ground motion in transverse direction (Vb,3D/W = 0.36 and Vb,3Dest/W = 0.271 when ν = 1), BSNE = -25.0%. The BSNEs for all values of ν are listed in Table 5.1. The signs and their interpretations (negative = underestimated, positive = overestimated) are consistent with AE, but the magnitude of the error has decreased relative to AE as BSNE represents an error in the full base-shear coefficient, rather than just the amplification term.
Figures 5.5 and 5.6 compare BSNE for the base-shear estimates in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively, for different values of the amplification factor ν. The trends are similar as those observed for AE, except that the error magnitudes are smaller. The average BSNE is around 0 for ν = 0.5, while the average increases (implying that the estimated base shear is more conservative) for ν = 1.0 and for ν computed by spectral acceleration. The potential for a large negative BSNE appears to exist only for the high-intensity motions and when ν is taken to be 0.5. A sufficiently conservative estimate is achieved, on the other hand, by using ν with the spectral acceleration amplification factor.
Based on results from both error estimation methods, BSNE is concluded to be a more meaningful error estimate than AE. Going forward, results from other parametric variations will be evaluated using BSNE alone. For moderate- to low-intensity vertical intense shaking, ν = 0.5 generally gives an adequate estimate of the base shear. For high-intensity vertical motions, the ν based on spectral amplification is, while more conservative, a better option to predict with base shear accurately. In the transverse direction, where coupling was observed between the transverse horizontal and vertical modes, the largest amplification factor can still underestimate the base shear for high-intensity vertical motions. Going forward, all amplification factors will be more comprehensively evaluated for a wider range of parameters.

This chapter describes parametric variations implemented on the Base Model bridge to evaluate the validity and accuracy of the proposed simplified method to predict amplified base shear under 3D motions. Section 6.1 considers isolation parameter variations applied to the Base Model bridge. Section 6.2 considers bridge parameters varied relative to the Base Model bridge. In both sections, the base-shear coefficients from RHA simulations are compared with the estimated base-shear coefficients obtained from simplified theory; analysis of the errors is presented. The validity of the proposed simplified method is further evaluated.

The Base Model bridge was modified to create nine different models by changing only the isolation properties (friction coefficients and pendulum lengths that determine the period associated with each portion of the normalized backbone curve); all other parameters remained the same. The objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed base-shear estimation methods and amplification factors across a range of isolation periods and friction coefficients. The isolation parameter variations listed in Table 3.3 were applied. Recall that µ2 is the friction coefficient and T2 is the period associated with the second slope of the normalized backbone curve (or sliding on the outer pendulum surfaces). All combinations of µ2 = 0.04, 0.06, and 0.08, and T2 = 2, 3.5, and 5 sec were considered. For each case, T1 = T2/4 and µ1 = µ2/4.
Simulated and estimated base-shear coefficients under 2D and 3D input to the SFPU motion (Group 1), LPG motion (Group 2), and IIB motion (Group 3) are shown in Figure 6.1 for all isolation system parameter variations. The general trend in base-shear coefficient for each motion and longitudinal or transverse direction is easily explained. The isolation period T2 = 2 sec for System Nos. 1–3, 3.5 sec for System Nos. 4–6, and 5 sec for System Nos. 7–9. Therefore, the actual base-shear coefficient decreases for each subgroup as the period increases. The base-shear coefficient also increases slightly over each subgroup as the friction coefficient increases (e.g., µ2 increases from 0.04 to 0.08 over System Nos. 1–3). The general trend observed in the figure is that the amplification of base shear (the increase from 2D to 3D) tends to be proportional to the intensity of the base shear. Therefore, the shorter period systems with higher base-shear coefficients also see greater amplification of base shear. For the high-intensity motion SFPU, amplification of the base-shear coefficient from 2D to 3D is significant for all isolation system parameters; see Figure 6.1(a)-(b). For the moderate- and low-intensity motions (LPG and IIB), the base-shear amplification is noticeable for the short-period T2 = 2 sec Systems 1–3, but is relatively small for other periods; see Figure 6.1(c)-(f).
A key observation is that the base-shear coefficient estimates follow the trends observed in the simulated base-shear coefficients. In other words, these estimated base-shear coefficients vary with T2 and µ2 in a manner consistent with the simulated base-shear coefficients shown in Figure 6.1. Recall that the dependence of base-shear amplification on these isolation system parameters is inherently captured through Equation (5.8). Increasing the amplification factor offers an increasing level of conservatism in the estimate.
For each pair of isolation parameters, the base-shear amplification and BSNE were evaluated for all motions, In addition, the average BSNE over the 11 motions was evaluated. Figure 6.2 compares average BSNE estimated for all amplification factors ν in the longitudinal direction [Figure 6.2(a)] and transverse direction [Figure 6.2(b)]. In general, the average BSNE is approximately constant with respect to isolation parameter variations, which confirms the observation that the base-shear estimates follow the trends shown in the simulations. In the longitudinal direction, the average BSNE increases slightly over the subgroups, which is correlated to increasing conservatism in the base-shear amplification estimate as the friction coefficient increases. The reason why is unclear, but the effect is slight, and the same trend is not apparent in the longitudinal direction.
The average BSNE provides insight as to which amplification factor might be most appropriate. For ν = 0.5, the average BSNE oscillates near 0 but tends to be slightly negative. The range of the average BSNE is -5% to 2% in the longitudinal direction and -9% to -3% in the longitudinal direction. Thus, although the average BSNE is small, this lower amplification factor is likely to underestimate the base-shear coefficient, and a more conservative estimate may be preferred. The average BSNE for ν = 1.0 varies from 20% to 30% in the longitudinal direction and 14% to 21% in the transverse direction. This appears to be a good choice for the amplification factor leading to sufficiently conservative, but not overly conservative estimates. Applying the vertical spectral acceleration to the amplification factor further increases conservatism so that average BSNE is in the 40% to 60% range. Thus, consistent with observations noted in Chapter 5, using the spectral acceleration of the vertical motion to represent the dynamic amplification effect does not appear to be necessary.

Figure 6.3 presents the same average BSNE as shown in Figure 6.2, but superimposed over scatter plots that depict BSNE for individual ground motions. The various amplification factors are represented in the different subfigures; ν = 0.5 in Figure 6.3(a) and (b), ν = 1.0 in Figure 6.3(c) and (d), and ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV in Figure 6.3(e) and (f). The average BSNE is depicted as a thick line with circle marker, while BSNE for individual ground motions are depicted by *.
The data in Figure 6.3 highlight the significant dispersion in the accuracy of the base-shear coefficient over the ground-motion suite. This suggests that for individual ground motions, the simplified method cannot estimate the base-shear amplification with high confidence. If the amplification factor is selected as ν = 0.5, even though average BSNE is near 0, there is a possibility that base shear is underestimated by as much as 20 to 40%. Although choosing ν = 1.0 significantly reduces the possibility that the base-shear estimate is grossly unconservative, it cannot eliminate the possibility of a negative error. Finally, applying the amplification factor ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV can almost eliminate the possibility of a negative error for individual motions, but as mentioned before, it is quite conservative on average.
 In summary, the amplification factor ν = 1.0 appears to lend itself to the most appropriately conservative base-shear estimates that account for the amplification from 2D to 3D shaking. Recalling the effect of ground-motion intensity (Figures 5.1 and 5.2), the motions that appear as negative outliers in Figure 6.3 are likely associated with high-intensity motions, suggesting a limit on the applicability of the simplified method to estimate base-shear amplification.

A bridge parameter study was performed to validate the accuracy of the proposed simplified methods to estimate base shear over a wide range of bridge parameters compared to the response of the Base Model bridge. The bridge parameter variations were presented in Table 3.2. Modal analysis was performed for all the various bridge models, and the first ten modes and associated periods for each bridge are tabulated below in Table 6.1. Again, for all bridge models, the isolator model was changed to a linear spring for modal analysis, corresponding to an isolation period of 3 sec.
Figure 6.4 plots some common mode shapes of the bridge models. The first three modes in all bridge models are the isolation modes: the first mode is the longitudinal isolation mode, the second mode is the transverse isolation mode, and the third mode is the torsional isolation mode. These first two modes in all bridges have periods greater than 3 sec, and the third mode has a period a bit less than 3 sec. All bridge models have a vertical C-shape mode with all span movement in the same direction, which tends to lead to very high mass participation of that mode in the vertical direction. Most bridges have more than one vertical S-shape mode wherein individual spans move in different directions. A transverse C-shape mode causes in-plane bending of the deck in one direction. A deck torsional mode is characterized by rotation of the deck in two different directions from each end such that deck is in torsion. In contrast, a deck rotational mode represents rotation of the deck in one direction.
The vertical mode with the 2C/3C/4C shape tends to be dominant and always shows up in the deck spectra, even if its period is higher than other modes. In this mode, the mass participation in vertical direction tends to be high—around 80%. Bridges 4, 5, and 8 have similar dynamic and modal properties as the Base Model (Bridge 1), and only the periods vary slightly according to the flexibility of each bridge. The close spacing of the vertical C-shape mode and transverse C-shape mode identified in the Base Model bridge (Figures 4.21 and 4.22) that led to modal coupling is also present in Bridges 4, 5, 7, and 8. Thus, transverse–vertical coupling would also be expected in Bridge 4, 5, 7, and 8. Bridges 2, 3, and 6 would not be expected to exhibit this coupling. In fact, for Bridge 6 the transverse mode does not appear in the first ten modes because the deck is very stiff in the transverse direction. In Bridge 3, the transverse mode and the vertical C-shape mode are not near each other, while in Bridge 2 the transverse mode and vertical C-shape modes are adjacent but the periods are far from each other.

A key observation is that differences in base-shear amplification on bridge models incorporating various bridge parameter variations—see Table 3.2—are very minor. Because the bridges are seismically isolated, the deck (regardless of its properties) moves essentially as a rigid mass on the sliding bearings. The differences in the estimated base-shear amplifications among the bridge parameter variations are also minor. Hence, the accuracy of the simplified method does not vary much among the bridge models. In particular, amplification factors ν = 0.5 and ν = 1.0 predict the same base-shear amplification for all bridge models as the amplification (Equation 5.8) is independent of bridge superstructure or substructure parameters. For ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV, the estimated base-shear amplification differs for different bridge models only due to changes in the period of the dominant vertical mode.
Under the Group 1 motion SFPU, the base-shear amplification is high for all bridge models in both longitudinal and transverse directions [Figure 6.5(a) and (b)]. Of the three motions considered, SFPU produces the greatest variation in base-shear amplification for different models. Increased randomness in the response is expected as the vertical shaking intensity increases, as well as a susceptibility to uplift and the impact of dynamic effects. Note: there is no correlation between base-shear amplification and the bridge models that were expected to be most susceptible to transverse–vertical coupling (Bridges 4, 5, 7, and 8). Only the spectral acceleration amplification factor, ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV, provides a conservative estimate of the base-shear amplification for this motion. Differences in spectral amplification due to vertical period shifts that affect the estimated base-shear coefficients are not consistent with simulated response.
The base-shear coefficient and its amplification due to vertical shaking is least sensitive to bridge modeling parameters for the Group 2 moderate-intensity motion LGP [Figure 6.5(c) and (d)]. The amplification factor ν = 0.5 is quite accurate for this motion. For the Group 3 low-intensity motion IIB, the simulated base-shear coefficient again shows some variation over bridge models (e.g., almost no amplification is observed for Bridge 3—a two-span bridge—in the longitudinal direction, while all other bridge models experience some amplification.) This result is a consequence of phase variation in the vertical and longitudinal response. Although it does not capture any variations in amplification over the bridge models, the amplification factor ν = 1.0 leads to accurate estimates for this motion.
The base-shear amplification and BSNE for each bridge model were evaluated for all motions. In addition, the average BSNE over the 11 motions was evaluated. Figure 6.6 compares the average BSNE estimated for all amplification factors ν in the longitudinal direction [Figure 6.6(a)] and transverse direction [Figure 6.6(b)]. The error trends with respect to bridge model variation are very similar to those found for isolation system parameter variation. That is, for each amplification factor, the BSNE is approximately constant—or varies within a narrow range—with the bridge parameter variation. The average BSNE is a little higher in the longitudinal direction (meaning the estimated base shear is more conservative) than in the transverse direction, which is likely due to the complexities associated with transverse–vertical coupling as mentioned previously. The average BSNE ranges are: -5% to 2% in the longitudinal direction and -7% to 1% in the transverse direction for ν = 0.5; 21% to 30% in the longitudinal direction and 15% to 27% in the transverse direction for ν = 1.0; and 40% to 61% in the longitudinal direction and 40% to 52% in the transverse direction for ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV.

Figure 6.7 superimposes the average BSNE on scatter plots of BSNE for individual ground motions to show the dispersion in the error estimates. Subfigures represent the various amplification factors in the longitudinal and transverse directions: ν = 0.5 [Figure 6.7(a) and (b)], ν = 1.0 [Figure 6.7(c) and (d)], and ν = Sa(Tv)/PGAV [Figure 6.7(e) and (f)]. The average BSNE is depicted as a thick line with circle marker, while BSNE for individual ground motions are depicted by *. Again, significant dispersion in the accuracy of the base-shear coefficient over the ground-motion suite is observed, meaning that the simplified method cannot estimate the base-shear amplification for individual motions with high confidence. The average BSNE is closest to 0; thus the estimate is the most accurate on average when the amplification factor ν is taken to be 0.5. However, at this time the amplification factor ν = 0.5 is not recommended for application because it lacks sufficient conservatism.
In summary, for the different isolation parameter variations and bridge model variations studied, the proposed method to estimate base shear for 3D shaking captures well the observed trends in base-shear coefficient. The three different amplification factors considered led to increasingly conservative estimates. While an amplification factor ν = 0.5 leads to the lowest average BSNE, it raises the possibility of significantly under-predicting the base-shear coefficient for individual ground motions. The amplification factor ν = 1.0 is recommended for predictions that are sufficient but not overly conservative. Statistical analysis over many ground motions and model variations is advisable to determine a “best fit” value of the amplification factor. Because of the complexities associated with high-intensity PGAV, determination of a threshold PGAV is envisioned above which the simplified method cannot reliably be applied, and 3D RHA procedures are recommended. Implementation of a PGAV limit may improve the reliability of the estimation method in the applicable range of ground-motion intensity.
