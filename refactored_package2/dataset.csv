building,"The earthquake led to the collapse of 72 buildings, including reinforced concrete, masonry and adobe construction."
building,"Collapsed reinforced concrete buildings were low to mid-rise (up to 6 stories), whereas collapsed masonry and adobe buildings were low-rise."
building,They show photos of three collapsed buildings.
building,"Specifically, it shows the photo of a 6-story reinforced concrete building in Elazig before the earthquake and the rubble due after the collapse of the building in the earthquake."
building,"There is no particular plan or elevation irregularity observed from the pre-earthquake photo, except some potential for torsional irregularity."
building,"However, information is not available about the structural system, member sizes, reinforcement ratios/detailing, and material characteristics, therefore it is difficult to provide any explanations about the collapse of the building."
building,"It is observed from this figure that other buildings around this building are low rise, therefore, there is a chance that the experienced ground motions had larger spectral accelerations at the natural frequency of this collapsed building."
building,"The buildings in them have several surrounding buildings with a similar number of stories and structural systems that remained intact, though experiencing damage; therefore observed collapses could be due to several deficiencies, low construction quality and any damage experienced in a prior earthquake."
building,"It is known that there is a very narrow boundary between collapse and survival for non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings, which could potentially explain why only a few of these possibly non-ductile buildings collapsed and others remained standing."
building,"However, information is not available about the seismic detailing of these buildings at the time this briefing was authored."
building,"Other than the collapsed buildings, there are buildings that experienced varying levels of damage, including severe damage in Doganyol, which is 9 km away from the epicenter."
building,All hospitals in the epicentral area remained operational after the earthquake.
building,Base isolation of hospitals is required by law in Turkey in seismic regions.
building,This earthquake demonstrated the benefits of this practice for resilience and functionality of essential services; it is hoped this encourages the greater adoption of base isolation and other protective systems beyond hospitals.
building,It is expected that damage accumulated through the previous earthquakes prior to the December 15 event.
building,"Even so, there were a , 2019, there were few partial and complete building collapses."
building,One reason for this is the relatively low levels of ground shaking in the order of 0.2g.
building,"However, similar to many previous earthquakes, failure of infill walls of reinforced concrete buildings was observed."
building,"It shows Matanao National High School at Matanao, Davao del Sur with infill walls failing under a combination of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) effects."
building,It is noted that the interaction of IP/OOP effects for these infill walls has been added to standards only recently (see 2017 version of ASCE41).
building,The damage in it was limited to the infill failures and did not instigate the formation of weak and soft stories that could have resulted in story collapses for this school.
building,"Therefore, infill walls had a positive effect on the response of the structure, though infill wall failures can contribute negatively to building collapses as observed in previous earthquakes and possibly even above."
building,"Infill wall failures also present a high risk of injury or death due to falling masonry rubble: Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of Matanao town in Davao del Sur province, indicated that a wall collapse led to the death of a six-year-old girl."
building,The debris can significantly increase the evacuation time in densely populated areas.
building,"Buildings, including historical structures, experienced damage during the earthquake."
building,A commonly observed damage is the out-of-plane failure of the brick veneer walls of wood frame buildings.
building,"A new school building in Herriman, Silver Crest Elementary, experienced similar damage to its front façade, where pieces of masonry fell to the ground."
building,Such masonry wall and façade failures present a high risk of injury or death due to falling rubble.
building,"Furthermore, debris can significantly increase the evacuation time in densely populated areas."
building,"If the earthquake occurred at a different time of day and the schools were not closed due to COVID-19 concerns, fallen masonry in this earthquake could have injured or killed people."
building,"The University of Utah’s Browning Building was closed due to cracks and nonstructural damage, including damage to suspended ceilings."
building,"The historic Rio Grande Depot, a brick building constructed in 1910 and housing historical artifacts, sustained minor damage."
building,"At the time of the earthquake, the iconic Salt Lake Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was in the early phases of a four-year upgrade, including a seismic retrofit."
building,"The golden Angel Moroni statue of the church was damaged and lost a trumpet, and some of the temple’s smaller spire stones shifted."
building,"In West Valley City, 48 mobile/manufactured homes were shifted off their foundations and experienced significant nonstructural utilities and contents damage."
building,"Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama indicated that more than 1,465 buildings in Tirana and about 900 in the nearby city Durres had been seriously damaged."
building,Many reinforced concrete (RC) and masonry buildings experienced collapse and severe damage.
building,Two hotels and two apartment blocks collapsed in Durres.
building,"Four buildings, including a five-story apartment block, collapsed in Thumane."
building,"At the time this briefing was authored, many people were still trapped in the remains of the ruined buildings."
building,An illustration of insufficient detailing from a collapsed RC building is provided by it: the exposed vertical element shows a lack of transverse reinforcement and failure in a diagonal plane associated with shear damage; the horizontal element in this figure is observed to have adequately anchored transverse reinforcement with only 90-degree hooks in place of the 135-degree seismic hooks necessary for confinement.
building,"These and other non-ductile features such as the presence of strong-beam/weak-column proportions, lack of confinement at member ends and connections and weak/soft stories potentially contributed to the observed collapses."
building,One of the commonly observed damage types of RC buildings in this earthquake is the In-Plane (IP)/Out-of-Plane (OOP) failures of infill walls.
building,"Fortunately, the damage in these photos was limited to the infill failures and did not result in the formation of weak and soft stories and consequent story collapses."
building,"However, infill wall failures may have contributed to other building collapses, similar to those observed during previous earthquakes in Europe."
building,Infill wall failures also present a high risk of injury or death due to falling masonry rubble.
building,"Related to the damage in masonry buildings, photos in the figure show the presence of multicell clay blocks."
building,These blocks are not only very brittle but they afford no options for reinforcing or grouting the cells to increase the wall strength and ductility.
building,"The use of such brittle material should be outlawed in all earthquake-prone areas, including Albania and other countries around the region."
building,"There was no structural damage to buildings, including several historical landmark structures in Tonopah and Goldfield around 60 km away from the epicenter."
building,"Over 20,000 houses were damaged with several collapses."
building,"Around 243,880 people were affected, and more than 52,000 people were displaced from impacted areas."
building,"Similar to previous earthquakes, these numbers highlight the social consequences of earthquakes, such as population displacement, highlighting the need for more regional-scale simulations of building and infrastructure performance in collaboration with social science experts."
building,"Towards this direction, using the real-time ground motions obtained from the strong motion networks and the city-scale nonlinear time-history analysis tool developed, the damage ratios of buildings across the earthquake-affected region were simulated."
building,The building damage distribution and estimate of shaking intensity felt by people near different ground motion stations are shown in figures respectively.
building,"These results, obtained in a fairly short time after the earthquake, have great potential to aid efficient organization of post-disaster response and recovery."
building,"In the long-term, comparison of these estimations with actual damage distributions will be helpful in evaluating the accuracy of the regional-scale simulations and making any necessary improvements, such that similar simulations, along with social science studies, can be used for decision making purposes to prepare for future earthquakes."
building,"The province of Zambales, the epicenter of the earthquake, had been spared from the earthquake destruction, while the neighboring province of Pampanga suffered damage to 29 structures/buildings and was the area most affected by the earthquake due to the presence of soft sediment and alluvial soil sites."
building,"Several structures in the province were damaged by the quake, including a 4-story supermarket in Porac, the Bataan-Pampanga boundary arch and the main terminal of Clark International Airport."
building,"Damage was observed in historical churches in Lubao and Porac, where the stone bell tower of the 19th-century Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church collapsed."
building,"Considering the relatively moderate level of shaking with the fact that collapse and similar damage was not observed in nearby structures, it can be stated that the collapse of the 4-story supermarket is due to the structural deficiencies such as short columns and deficient beam-column joints."
building,"Similar to many previous earthquakes, the Philippines quake highlighted the vulnerability of non-ductile reinforced concrete structures and historical masonry structures indicating the immediate need for retrofit to avoid such damages in the future."
building,"In that regard, research should continue to develop proper retrofit techniques for these types of structures, while maintaining the cultural value and distinctive architecture of historical structures."
building,A 10-story school building in Manila (Emilio Aguinaldo College) was reported to have tilted and leaned onto the adjacent building.
building,Soil liquefaction underneath the building was indicated as the probable cause.
building,"This tilting demonstrates the effect of far field ground motions and the ground motion amplification due to local soil conditions, considering that the distance between the epicenter of the earthquake and Manila is around 60 km."
building,"Furthermore, the structure being a school building increases the severity of the situation."
infrastructure,"Salt Lake City International Airport, close to the epicenter, was shut down after the earthquake and passengers were evacuated."
infrastructure,It reopened almost six hours later after a water line in one of the concourses was fixed.
infrastructure,"There has not been any major bridge damage, but because of possible structural damage, the Utah Department of Transportation has closed the ramp to the westbound lanes of Interstate 215 at Union Park Boulevard."
infrastructure,Front Runner trains did not operate between Murray and Salt Lake City for two hours.
infrastructure,"All other trains traveled at restricted speeds during the day, lengthening commutes."
infrastructure,"TRAX train service did not resume until Wednesday (March 18 th, 2020) evening."
infrastructure,Slow-down and stopping of trains is common around the world after earthquakes.
infrastructure,"In several countries, including the US, China, Taiwan, Japan, and Turkey, this is performed by automated processes using Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems."
infrastructure,"In some other countries, like Canada, it is pursued as part of protective measures after earthquakes."
infrastructure,"The earthquake also caused a Hydrochloric acid leakage of 8,200 gallons at Rio Tinto Kennecott’s refinery, forcing it to stop all operations and evacuate personnel."
infrastructure,"According to the Salt Lake County emergency officials, a chemical plume was released at the refinery and moved toward the Great Salt Lake."
infrastructure,The leakage was later contained.
infrastructure,"Because the earthquake caused significant building damage, collapses and consequent fatalities, almost all of the preliminary information is on buildings."
infrastructure,"At the time this briefing was authored, there was not much information available related to the damage of other infrastructure, though the photo in it shows significant road damage in the capital city Tirana."
infrastructure,"Other than buildings, several major roads were damaged including the official Xinhua News agency reports of damage to the highway between Yibin city and Xuyong county."
infrastructure,Five dams in Central Luzon were damaged and needed immediate repairs according to the National Irrigation Administration.
infrastructure,"The Cong Dadong Dam in Arayat, Pampanga showed cracks, with repairs estimated to be around $1 million."
infrastructure,"The Mangindong Dam in Dinalupihan, Bataan had cracks on a footbridge with repairs estimated at $0.5 million."
infrastructure,"Moreover, damages in Bataan included the Balsik Dam in the town of Hermosa, where a portion of the main canal collapsed."
infrastructure,Repairs to the dam are expected to cost $0.25 million.
infrastructure,"In Zambales, NIA also reported cracks on a portion of the Bucao Intake facility in the town of Bucao."
infrastructure,Cracks were also noted on the retaining walls of a diversion dam in the Barangay of San Pablo in the town of Castillejos.
infrastructure,"Repairs to the two facilities are expected to be around $0.75 million, according to NIA."
infrastructure,"The total repair costs of dams are expected to be $2.5 million, highlighting the consequences of even low levels of damage after moderate earthquakes."
infrastructure,"This demonstrates the importance of performance-based earthquake engineering for the design and assessment of not only buildings, but also for critical infrastructure."
infrastructure,There was no damage observed in power and transportation networks.
infrastructure,"However, power outages were reported in several provinces and train lines in Metro Manila were closed for the rest of the day, disrupting community functionality for less than a day, which is a reasonable outcome for this level of an earthquake."
resilience,"USGS PAGER tool estimated the fatalities to be between 1 and 10, between 10 and 100, and between 100 and 1000 with probabilities of 22%, 47%, and 25%, respectively."
resilience,"There were 29 casualties at the time this briefing was authored, with over 1000 more were injured."
resilience,"Economic loss was expected to be between $1 million and $10 million, between $10 million and $100 million, between $100 million and $1,000 million, and between $1,000 million and $10,000 million with probabilities of 5%, 28%, 43%, and 20%, respectively."
resilience,"There were no major interruptions to electricity, water, gas, and telecommunication services, which indicated good performance in terms of community resilience."
resilience,"However, rescue operations and building inspections, including school buildings, are still under way and expected to take some time to complete."
resilience,"Therefore, recovery is from this event is expected to follow a short to medium timeline."
resilience,"The epicenter of the tremor was south of the populous city of Davao on the southern island of Mindanao, the same island that was struck by the three magnitude 6.4+ earthquakes in October 2019."
resilience,"The Mindanao region, which covers a third of the Philippines, is home to around 22 million people, therefore earthquake risk is a major concern for the Philippines population."
resilience,"USGS PAGER tool estimated the fatalities in this event to be less than 1, between 1 and 10, and between 10 and 100 with a probability of 65%, 30% and 4%, respectively."
resilience,"At the time this briefing was released, the number of deaths as a consequence of the earthquake was reported as 9 and there were approximately 111 injuries, with one person still missing."
resilience,"Economic loss and damage were expected to be less than $1 million, between $1 million and $10 million, and between $10 million and $100 million with probabilities of 46%, 36% and 15%, respectively."
resilience,"USGS PAGER tool estimated the fatalities to be “none”, “between 1 and 10”, and “between 10 and 100” with probabilities of 65%, 30%, and 4%, respectively."
resilience,There were no reports of casualties or injuries due to this earthquake.
resilience,"Economic loss was expected to be “less than $1 million”, “between $1 million and $10 million”, “between $10 million and $100 million”, “between $100 million and $1,000 million”, and “between $1,000 million and $10,000 million” with probabilities of 4%, 15%, 33%, 32%, and 14%, respectively."
resilience,"There were power outages in several cities, lasting up to half a day."
resilience,"As previously mentioned, trains, the airport and a bridge were all suspended from service for a period of time."
resilience,"Other than these limited cases, there were no major interruptions in electricity, water, gas, and telecommunication services, indicative of good performance from the perspective of community resilience."
resilience,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional challenges due to social distancing and further anxiety experienced by the residents.
resilience,"On a positive note, Salt Lake Mayor Erin Mendenhall indicated that being prepared for a pandemic meant being prepared for an earthquake in several aspects such as shelter-in-place along with pantries stocked with a couple of weeks’ worth of nonperishable foods and well-supplied first aid kits."
resilience,"USGS PAGER tool estimated the fatalities to be between 1 and 10 with a probability of 12%, between 10 and 100 with a probability of 37%, between 100 and 1,000 with a probability of 37% and between 1,000 and 10,000 with a probability of 12%."
resilience,"At the time this briefing was authored, the number of deaths as a consequence of the earthquake was reported as 51 and there were approximately 2,000 injuries."
resilience,"Damages were expected to be between $1 million and $10 million, between $10 million and $100 million, and between $100 million and $1,000 million with probabilities of 8%, 25% and 36%, respectively."
resilience,"Furthermore, there were probabilities of 22% and 6% of the economic loss to be between $1,000 million and $10,000 million and between $10,000 million and $100,000 million, respectively."
resilience,"Given the severity of the situation, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama declared a state of emergency in Tirana and Durres during December."
resilience,"Recovery efforts are currently continuing in the rubble of collapsed buildings, where residents and emergency crews in cities across the country rescued 45 people from some of the collapsed buildings."
resilience,"Considering the state of emergency and current situation, the recovery and reconstruction process after this earthquake is likely to be lengthy."
resilience,"The earthquake left around 4,000 people homeless."
resilience,"Similar to many previous earthquakes, even the residents of houses and buildings that were still standing, which performed well, remained outside after the earthquake."
resilience,"One of the residents in the capital Tirana indicated he did not know where he would live and described his apartment as “uninhabitable.” An estimated 2,500 people have been displaced by the earthquake and are temporarily being sheltered either in the Niko Dovana Stadium of Durres in tents or in hotels."
resilience,"Particularly because of the very shallow nature of the earthquake (depth of 2.8 km), this earthquake was felt across a wide region: from Las Vegas, about 280 kilometers to the southeast of the epicenter, all the way to the San Francisco Bay Area, about 450 kilometers to the epicenter’s west."
resilience,"Although shaking was felt across a large area, as mentioned earlier, levels of shaking were too small to cause significant damage, injuries or fatalities."
resilience,"The USGS “Did you Feel It?” program documented low levels of shaking in populated areas based on 22,000 voluntary self-reports."
resilience,"Regarding the consequences of the earthquake, USGS PAGER tool estimated that the fatalities are expected to be less than 1 (which is indeed the case for this event), between 1 and 10, and between 10 and 100, with probabilities of 65%, 30%, and 4%, respectively."
resilience,"Regarding economic losses, this USGS tool also estimated with 100% certainty that such loss would be under $1 million."
resilience,"Still, this event is another reminder of the potential of major earthquakes taking place in the U.S."
resilience,"Similar to the Mw 6.5 Idaho earthquake, had the earthquake occurred closer to populous areas with this shallow depth, there could have been severe consequences, and these, combined with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could have introduced additional stresses on the affected population along with potential economic challenges."
resilience,"A potential complication in that case would be due to the normal practice of placing displaced people in mass evacuation centers, where the social distancing requirements would not be possible."
