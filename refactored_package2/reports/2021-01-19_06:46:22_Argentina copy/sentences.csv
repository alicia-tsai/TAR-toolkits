"He said the agency regretted the inconvenience caused by its messages, which he blamed on a technical error.",building
The tsunami warning for Antarctica was later lifted.,building
"People in coastal cities including La Serena, to the north of Santiago, and Valparaiso, started to leave areas close to the coast after the warning until reports started appearing that it was a false alarm.",building
"But as Chileans were reacting to the warning, a second tremor, of magnitude 5.6, struck the Chile-Argentina border region, at 9.07 p.m., the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences said, at a depth of 133 km and 30km east of Santiago.",building
No damage was reported from either quake.,building

The army said no damage was reported at the Antarctic base.,building
