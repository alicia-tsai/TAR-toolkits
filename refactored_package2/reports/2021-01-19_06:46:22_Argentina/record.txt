On January 19, 2021, at approximately 3:46 local time, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, with a depth of 20.0 km, struck 27 km Southwest of of Pocito, Argentina. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 31.8232°S, 68.8182°W.

The South American arc extends over 7,000 km, from the Chilean margin 
triple junction offshore of southern Chile to its intersection with the Panama 
fracture zone, offshore of the southern coast of Panama in Central America. 
It marks the plate boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the 
South America plate, where the oceanic crust and lithosphere of the Nazca 
plate begin their descent into the mantle beneath South America. The 
convergence associated with this subduction process is responsible for the 
uplift of the Andes Mountains, and for the active volcanic chain present along 
much of this deformation front. Relative to a fixed South America plate, the 
Nazca plate moves slightly north of eastwards at a rate varying from 
approximately 80 mm/yr in the south to approximately 65 mm/yr in the north.  
Although the rate of subduction varies little along the entire arc, there are 
complex changes in the geologic processes along the subduction zone that 
dramatically influence volcanic activity, crustal deformation, earthquake 
generation and occurrence all along the western edge of South America.

Most of the large earthquakes in South America are constrained to shallow 
depths of 0 to 70 km resulting from both crustal and interplate deformation. 
Crustal earthquakes result from deformation and mountain building in the 
overriding South America plate and generate earthquakes as deep as 
approximately 50 km. Interplate earthquakes occur due to slip along the 
dipping interface between the Nazca and the South American plates. 
Interplate earthquakes in this region are frequent and often large, and occur 
between the depths of approximately 10 and 60 km.  Since 1900, numerous 
magnitude 8 or larger earthquakes have occurred on this subduction zone 
interface that were followed by devastating tsunamis, including the 1960 M9.5 
earthquake in southern Chile, the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in 
the world. Other notable shallow tsunami-generating earthquakes include the 
1906 M8.5 earthquake near Esmeraldas, Ecuador, the 1922 M8.5 earthquake 
near Coquimbo, Chile, the 2001 M8.4 Arequipa, Peru earthquake, the 2007 
M8.0 earthquake near Pisco, Peru, and the 2010 M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake 
located just north of the 1960 event.

Large intermediate-depth earthquakes (those occurring between depths of 
approximately 70 and 300 km) are relatively limited in size and spatial extent in 
South America, and occur within the Nazca plate as a result of internal 
deformation within the subducting plate. These earthquakes generally cluster 
beneath northern Chile and southwestern Bolivia, and to a lesser extent beneath 
northern Peru and southern Ecuador, with depths between 110 and 130 km. Most 
of these earthquakes occur adjacent to the bend in the coastline between Peru 
and Chile. The most recent large intermediate-depth earthquake in this region was 
the 2005 M7.8 Tarapaca, Chile earthquake.

Earthquakes can also be generated to depths greater than 600 km as a 
result of continued internal deformation of the subducting Nazca plate. 
Deep-focus earthquakes in South America are not observed from a depth 
range of approximately 300 to 500 km. Instead, deep earthquakes in this 
region occur at depths of 500 to 650 km and are concentrated into two 
zones: one that runs beneath the Peru-Brazil border and another that 
extends from central Bolivia to central Argentina. These earthquakes 
generally do not exhibit large magnitudes. An exception to this was the 
1994 Bolivian earthquake in northwestern Bolivia. This M8.2 earthquake occurred at a depth of 631 km, which was until recently the largest deep-focus earthquake instrumentally recorded (superseded in May 2013 by a M8.3 earthquake 610 km beneath the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia), and was felt widely throughout South and North America.

Subduction of the Nazca plate is geometrically complex and impacts the geology 
and seismicity of the western edge of South America. The intermediate-depth 
regions of the subducting Nazca plate can be segmented into five sections based 
on their angle of subduction beneath the South America plate. Three segments are 
characterized by steeply dipping subduction; the other two by near-horizontal 
subduction. The Nazca plate beneath northern Ecuador, southern Peru to northern 
Chile, and southern Chile descend into the mantle at angles of 25° to 30°. In contrast, 
the slab beneath southern Ecuador to central Peru, and under central Chile, is 
subducting at a shallow angle of approximately 10° or less.  In these regions of 
“flat-slab” subduction, the Nazca plate moves horizontally for several hundred 
kilometers before continuing its descent into the mantle, and is shadowed by an 
extended zone of crustal seismicity in the overlying South America plate. Although the 
South America plate exhibits a chain of active volcanism resulting from the subduction 
and partial melting of the Nazca oceanic lithosphere along most of the arc, these 
regions of inferred shallow subduction correlate with an absence of volcanic activity.

On January 19, 2021, at approximately 3:46 local time, a magnitude 6.4 earthquake, with a depth of 20.0 km, struck 27 km Southwest of of Pocito, Argentina. The coordinate of epicenter of the earthquake was 31.8232°S, 68.8182°W.

The South American arc extends over 7,000 km, from the Chilean margin 
triple junction offshore of southern Chile to its intersection with the Panama 
fracture zone, offshore of the southern coast of Panama in Central America. 
It marks the plate boundary between the subducting Nazca plate and the 
South America plate, where the oceanic crust and lithosphere of the Nazca 
plate begin their descent into the mantle beneath South America. The 
convergence associated with this subduction process is responsible for the 
uplift of the Andes Mountains, and for the active volcanic chain present along 
much of this deformation front. Relative to a fixed South America plate, the 
Nazca plate moves slightly north of eastwards at a rate varying from 
approximately 80 mm/yr in the south to approximately 65 mm/yr in the north.  
Although the rate of subduction varies little along the entire arc, there are 
complex changes in the geologic processes along the subduction zone that 
dramatically influence volcanic activity, crustal deformation, earthquake 
generation and occurrence all along the western edge of South America.

Most of the large earthquakes in South America are constrained to shallow 
depths of 0 to 70 km resulting from both crustal and interplate deformation. 
Crustal earthquakes result from deformation and mountain building in the 
overriding South America plate and generate earthquakes as deep as 
approximately 50 km. Interplate earthquakes occur due to slip along the 
dipping interface between the Nazca and the South American plates. 
Interplate earthquakes in this region are frequent and often large, and occur 
between the depths of approximately 10 and 60 km.  Since 1900, numerous 
magnitude 8 or larger earthquakes have occurred on this subduction zone 
interface that were followed by devastating tsunamis, including the 1960 M9.5 
earthquake in southern Chile, the largest instrumentally recorded earthquake in 
the world. Other notable shallow tsunami-generating earthquakes include the 
1906 M8.5 earthquake near Esmeraldas, Ecuador, the 1922 M8.5 earthquake 
near Coquimbo, Chile, the 2001 M8.4 Arequipa, Peru earthquake, the 2007 
M8.0 earthquake near Pisco, Peru, and the 2010 M8.8 Maule, Chile earthquake 
located just north of the 1960 event.

Large intermediate-depth earthquakes (those occurring between depths of 
approximately 70 and 300 km) are relatively limited in size and spatial extent in 
South America, and occur within the Nazca plate as a result of internal 
deformation within the subducting plate. These earthquakes generally cluster 
beneath northern Chile and southwestern Bolivia, and to a lesser extent beneath 
northern Peru and southern Ecuador, with depths between 110 and 130 km. Most 
of these earthquakes occur adjacent to the bend in the coastline between Peru 
and Chile. The most recent large intermediate-depth earthquake in this region was 
the 2005 M7.8 Tarapaca, Chile earthquake.

Earthquakes can also be generated to depths greater than 600 km as a 
result of continued internal deformation of the subducting Nazca plate. 
Deep-focus earthquakes in South America are not observed from a depth 
range of approximately 300 to 500 km. Instead, deep earthquakes in this 
region occur at depths of 500 to 650 km and are concentrated into two 
zones: one that runs beneath the Peru-Brazil border and another that 
extends from central Bolivia to central Argentina. These earthquakes 
generally do not exhibit large magnitudes. An exception to this was the 
1994 Bolivian earthquake in northwestern Bolivia. This M8.2 earthquake occurred at a depth of 631 km, which was until recently the largest deep-focus earthquake instrumentally recorded (superseded in May 2013 by a M8.3 earthquake 610 km beneath the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia), and was felt widely throughout South and North America.

Subduction of the Nazca plate is geometrically complex and impacts the geology 
and seismicity of the western edge of South America. The intermediate-depth 
regions of the subducting Nazca plate can be segmented into five sections based 
on their angle of subduction beneath the South America plate. Three segments are 
characterized by steeply dipping subduction; the other two by near-horizontal 
subduction. The Nazca plate beneath northern Ecuador, southern Peru to northern 
Chile, and southern Chile descend into the mantle at angles of 25° to 30°. In contrast, 
the slab beneath southern Ecuador to central Peru, and under central Chile, is 
subducting at a shallow angle of approximately 10° or less.  In these regions of 
“flat-slab” subduction, the Nazca plate moves horizontally for several hundred 
kilometers before continuing its descent into the mantle, and is shadowed by an 
extended zone of crustal seismicity in the overlying South America plate. Although the 
South America plate exhibits a chain of active volcanism resulting from the subduction 
and partial melting of the Nazca oceanic lithosphere along most of the arc, these 
regions of inferred shallow subduction correlate with an absence of volcanic activity.
