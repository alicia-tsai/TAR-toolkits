The prime minister has pledged all homeless will be in “stronger homes” in 2020.
One of the heavily damaged buildings has been demolished by the authorities and a dozen others are expected to be flattened.
"A new law has been drafted that will ensure investors, architects and supervisors are imprisoned for seven to 15 years for any violation of construction norms. "
That and corruption in Albania’s burgeoning building industry have been blamed for much of the devastation caused by the earthquake.
"The government has set up financial compensations for families of the dead, including 1 million lek ($9,000) per family, special pensions for elders and scholarships for children."
Tuesday’s earthquake was the second powerful quake to hit the region in two months.

At least 23 killed as 6.4-magnitude earthquake strikes Albania
"At least 23 people have been killed, several more are missing and hundreds have been injured after an earthquake struck Albania on Tuesday."
"The quake, which had a preliminary rating of 6.4 magnitude, hit the European nation at an approximate depth of 20 kilometers (12 miles) early Tuesday local time, according to the United States Geological Survey. "
It is the strongest to hit Albania in 40 years.

Albania quake toll hits 51 as search for survivors ends
A 4-day search and rescue operation following the 6.4 magnitude quake has been declared over. 
"Prime Minister Edi Rama promised the 4,000 residents made homeless they would be in ""stronger homes"" by next year."
Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama on Saturday said all bodies had been retrieved from the ruins of thousands of buildings struck by Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude earthquake.

Rama later told a news conference that 41 people remain hospitalized and that the damage assessment has begun. 
"He said more than 1,465 buildings in Tirana and about 900 in nearby Durres had been seriously damaged."
The first of about a dozen buildings needing to be demolished has been flattened. 
"Another 265 now require expert evaluation, he added."
"Tuesday's quake left entire families crushed in their homes while they were sleeping, forcing relatives and neighbors to watch in agony as rescue teams pulled bodies from the ruins."
Commentators say the damage may have been made worse by lax construction standards when the Albanian coast was speedily developed after the fall of communism in the 1990s.
"The cabinet discussed drafting a draconian construction law with harsh punishments, of up to 15 years in prison, for violators who jeopardize safety, Rama added."

Albania Earthquake Kills at Least 23
"The 6.4-magnitude quake, one of the strongest to hit the country in decades, struck near Tirana, the capital. "
Hundreds of injuries were reported.
"Rescuers in Albania dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings in search of survivors on Tuesday, after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the Balkan nation, killing at least 23 people and injuring 650."
"Using everything from earth-moving equipment to their bare hands, local residents and emergency crews in cities across the country had pulled 45 people alive from under mounds of debris by the evening, the government said. "
Thirty people were hospitalized.
"The deadly quake was the strongest to hit Albania in decades, in a region known for its devastating temblors, and came just two months after the country was struck by another strong quake that damaged hundred of homes. "
"Across the country, buildings crumbled, fallen facades left structures ripped open to the elements, and many others had ominous cracks snaking across their walls."
"Scores of residents in Albania’s second-largest city woke up in tents, cars and a soccer stadium, as rescue teams looked through the rubble."
"In Durres, a hard-hit coastal city, the seven-story Vila Palma hotel collapsed, crushing cars parked underneath, but there was no immediate word on casualties. "
"Many buildings on the outskirts of the city were also destroyed, raining concrete and bricks onto streets, vehicles and gardens."
"“What we are seeing now is a very strong, very powerful sequence of earthquakes,” said Jadranka Mihaljevic, the head of engineering in the seismology department of the Institute for Hydrometeorology and Seismology in neighboring Montenegro, where she said the earthquake was felt across the country."
"The earthquake struck at 3:54 a.m. near the Adriatic coast, about 19 miles west of Tirana, home to nearly 900,000 people."
"A resident of Tirana, George-Ilias Belidis, was sleeping in his apartment when a powerful, seemingly interminable tremor jolted him awake, and he said he thought his end had come."
"“Everything was moving in an unbelievable rhythm, I could hear the walls cracking, dishes and glass breaking,” "
"Mr. Belidis, a 24-year-old Greek citizen, said by phone a few hours after experienced the deadly quake “in all its rage.”"
"Videos and pictures shared on social media showed chaotic scenes of residents rummaging through the rubble, or trying to extricate people trapped under collapsed buildings. "
"In one video, a group of people in Durres struggled in darkness to extract a young boy who was trapped in the wreckage crying out in pain."
"In Elbasan, a town about 35 miles from Durres, Olsi Shehi, a 39-year-old cook, said a four-story house had fallen, trapping people inside. "
"“I could hear six people screaming to get them out,” he said."
"Albania’s president, Ilir Meta, described the situation “dramatic” as he visited Thumane, the town closest to the epicenter, where several people died. "
"“We hope to overcome it with the least loss,” he wrote in a post on Twitter that included pictures of him talking with local people and an army officer."
"In a statement, Mr. Meta vowed that rescuers would “save every human life under the rubble of buildings” and help the injured. "
"It was unclear how many people were still trapped, but locals worried the death toll could rise considerably."
"As many as 1.2 million people may have faced “strong” and “very strong” shaking, according to the United States Geological Survey."
"Seismologists said that the quake and its aftershocks were felt in neighboring Montenegro, in some parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in southern Italy. "
"Hours later, a 5.4-magnitude quake struck southern Bosnia and Herzegovina; there were no immediate reports of injuries or fatalities."
"On Sept. 21, a 5.6-magnitude quake in Albania injured dozens of people and damaged hundreds of homes in the same area hit on Tuesday. "
Officials and seismologists said that quake was the strongest to strike the country in 30 years.
"Ms. Mihaljevic said the stability of the buildings in Albania might have been greatly compromised by the previous earthquake, and that their fragile state could lead to increased fatalities."
"As the Albanian authorities requested international help, Montenegro and Serbia sent support and rescue teams, according to Prime Minister Edi Rama, who added that various leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, were preparing to help."
"Emergency teams from Kosovo, Romania, Italy and Greece joined the effort, and European Union officials said they had reached out to Albania’s government to offer assistance."
Countries in the Balkans and in southern Europe have a long history of destructive earthquakes. 
"In 1999, a 7.6-magnitude quake killed 17,000 people in Turkey; and in 2016, more than 241 people died in a 6.2-magnitude quake in central Italy, seven years after the deadly Abruzzo earthquake that left more than 300 people dead."
"A series of quakes also ravaged the region in the late 1970s, killing more than 1,500 people in Romania in 1977, dozens in Greece in 1978, and hundreds in 1979 in what was then Yugoslavia."
"“The deadly 1977-1979 series was followed by a quiet period where new seismic energy was accumulating,” Ms. Mihaljevic said. "
"“But after 40 years of relatively calm seismicity, strong quakes seem to be back.”"
"Many residents who rushed out of their houses in Tirana or Durres in the early hours of Tuesday, only to face numerous aftershocks in the open air."
"Mr. Belidis, the 24-year-old Tirana resident, said he didn't know where he would live, describing his apartment as “uninhabitable.”"
"Even in houses and buildings that were still standing, the quake left walls bulging, and their inhabitants, most of whom remained outside even after the earthquake ended, terrified."
"“Some were on the street, others in their cars,” said Mr. Shehi, in Durres. "
"“You look around and you think, ‘We’re lucky we’re alive.’”"
"Northwestern Albania was struck by a strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake with an epicentre 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west-southwest of Mamurras, at 03:54 CET (UTC+1) on 26 November 2019."
"The earthquake lasted at least 50 seconds and was felt in Albania's capital Tirana, and in places as far away as Taranto and Belgrade, 370 kilometres (230 mi) northeast of the epicentre. "
The maximum felt intensity was VIII (Severe) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale. 
"A total of 51 people were killed in the earthquake, with about 3,000 injured."
It was the second earthquake to strike the region in the space of three months.
"It was the strongest earthquake to hit Albania in more than 40 years, its deadliest earthquake in 99 years and the world's deadliest earthquake in 2019."
"Albania lies across the convergent boundary between the Eurasian Plate and the Adriatic Plate, part of the complex collision zone with the African Plate. "
The structure of the western part of Albania is dominated by active thrust tectonics. 
"The region is seismically active, with several M ≥ 6 earthquakes in the last hundred years. "
"In 1979, the largest of these events struck 70 kilometres (43 mi) further north, in Montenegro, killing 136 people (101 in Montenegro and 35 in Albania)."
"The most recent significant earthquake in the area was an M 5.6 event on 21 September 2019 with an epicentre ENE of Durrës, which was at the time the most powerful in 30 years and damaged 500 houses."
"The earthquake had magnitude of 6.4 Mww, according to the ANSS Comprehensive Catalog. "
"The observed focal mechanism is consistent with reverse movement on a NW-SE trending fault, parallel to the known thrust faults in the area. "
The maximum perceived intensity was VIII (severe) on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale (MMI). 
Modelling using a combination of data from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and interferometric synthetic-aperture radar (InSAR) provides further constraints on the fault that moved during the earthquake. 
This suggests that the rupture plane had a dip of 23° to the east-northeast at a depth of about 16.5 km. 
The estimated displacement on this thrust fault is 0.55 m over a rupture with dimensions 22 km x 13 km.
"By 1 December, there had been 1,300 aftershocks."
As of 02:00 (UTC) 27 January 2020 there had been five aftershocks that were greater than M 5.0 and a further forty-five between M 4 and 5.
"The largest aftershock occurred at 07:08 CET (UTC+1), less than four hours after the mainshock, with a magnitude of M 5.4."
This event caused shaking of intensity VII (very strong).
"The damage was mostly in the large port city of Durrës and the village of Kodër-Thumanë, which are near the epicentre of the earthquake."
Two hotels and two apartment blocks collapsed in Durrës.
"Four buildings, including a five-storey apartment block, collapsed in Kodër-Thumanë and the town was hardest hit from the earthquake."
The town of Laç was extensively damaged.
"A state of emergency lasting 30 days was declared by the Albanian government for Durrës, Thumanë and Tirana and later extended to Lezhë and Laç."
"In accordance with the Albanian constitution regarding an emergency situation, the Albanian parliament granted Prime Minister Edi Rama state of emergency powers to deal with earthquake aftermath."
Aftershocks followed that shook structures ruined during the earthquake and caused concern among locals.
Subsequently numerous homes were no longer safe to reside in.
"Albanian soldiers, numbering in the hundreds, and some 2,000 Albanian police officers were dispatched to the earthquake affected localities of Thumanë, Durrës, and the nearby wider area."
They were tasked to assist with the rescue operation and the installation of shelter facilities for displaced people.
"Three hundred emergency tents to shelter some 1,000 people were erected at a sportsfield within Thumanë and close to a stadium in Durrës."
Albanian troops working with limited resources rescued people from debris of collapsed structures and they were assisted by 250 troops from the United States and various European countries.
"As the last severe earthquake in Albania was in 1979, it lacked expertise in rescue operations."
"Subsequently, rescue crews with specialised equipment, sniffer dogs and emergency supplies came to Albania from neighbouring countries and other European nations to help in the search efforts and provide for those left homeless."
"In total, people from foreign countries involved in search and rescue numbered 670."
"Many homeless people in Kodër-Thumanë spent two nights in tents, refusing to stay in hotels on the Adriatic Sea. "
"Special forces (RENEA) continued searching for several people that were reported missing, and at least 45 individuals were rescued alive from the rubble."
"The aftershocks, some of which were quite large, made it difficult for the search and rescue teams. "
"Albania's Minister of Health Ogerta Manastirliu initially announced over 900 injuries, of which 731 were treated at the hospitals in Tirana and Durrës alone."
"Reports from the Ministry of Health stated that care was provided for 62 injured people who were in a stable condition, with the exception of 3 people in intensive care."
"Later, official information from the government confirmed 51 people were killed in the earthquake - 25 in Durrës, 25 in Thumanë, and 1 in Lezhë."
Among the deceased were 7 children aged between 2-8.
"Following the earthquake an additional 2 people from Kurbin died, one from their injuries in hospital and another through suicide, due to posttraumatic stress."
"In the aftermath of the event, 5,200 locals were without any shelter."
Forty five people trapped in earthquake debris were rescued.
"An Albanian military owned dwelling in Durrës, social centres in Tirana and various privately owned buildings such as 90 gyms in Krujë, Tirana, Lezhë, Durrës and numerous hotels in Vlorë, Durrës and Tirana were adapted and opened to shelter displaced people."
"Some 2,500 displaced people have been housed in hotels, another 2,100 are in tents, whereas others affected by the earthquake slept in gyms or their cars."
"In Durrës, authorities distributed food throughout the city and reports of complaints emerged that some people had not yet obtained supplies."
"Due to safety concerns and aftershocks, some people were not allowed to reenter their own homes and became dependent on food donations until engineers checked buildings."
"Stemming from concerns caused by the earthquake, there were locals who did not want to return to their homes."
Displaced people have been relocated to Kosovo with 500 residing in a former German NATO military base in Prizren refitted as a temporary camp by the Kosovo government.
"Some displaced people are housed in the Kosovan municipalities of Lipjan numbering 3 families, 11 families with 48 members in Podujevë, 70 people in Malishevë, 150 people in Pristina and others in Gjakova."
Other people have gone to eastern Albania.
Albanian physicians assisted in relief efforts.
"Albanian President Ilir Meta, Prime Minister Rama and opposition leader Lulzim Basha visited the earthquake epicentre to see firsthand the situation and damage."
"The often fraught political rivalry between Meta, Rama and Basha was put aside as all three were involved in relief efforts."
National operational centres were established by the Albanian government along with a phone line for people affected by the earthquake needing clothes or food.
"In the immediate aftermath, 2,500 people became displaced by the earthquake and are temporarily being accommodated either in the Niko Dovana Stadium of Durrës in tents or in hotels."
Turkey evacuated 23 of its citizens from Albania to a hospital located in Izmir province.
"On 30 November Prime Minister Rama announced the end of the search and rescue operation, as no more bodies were expected to be under the rubble."
"According to his statement, about 2,000 people were injured from the earthquake in total, with more than 4,000 being left homeless in the disaster's aftermath. "
"Preliminary figures showed that more than 1,465 buildings in the capital Tirana suffered serious damage, in addition to about 900 in nearby Durrës."
The first funeral for the deceased was held on Friday with hundreds of people in attendance including President Meta and Prime Minister Rama.

"In early February 2020, the Albanian government publicised figures that earthquake damage to private and public properties cost €844 million."
"Full reconstruction costs are estimated at €1.07 billion, with €800 million devoted to the rebuilding of homes and the rest allocated for repairing health centres, schools and infrastructure damaged by the earthquake."
"Other structures, such as 321 kindergartens and schools sustained €72 million worth of damage."
"A total of 11,490 homes were rendered damaged or destroyed and another 83,000 are in need of repairs."
