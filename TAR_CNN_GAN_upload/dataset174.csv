building,"There is no particular plan or elevation irregularity observed from the pre-earthquake photo, except some potential for torsional irregularity.",report,,
building,"However, information is not available about the structural system, member sizes, reinforcement ratios/detailing, and material characteristics, therefore it is difficult to provide any explanations about the collapse of the building.",report,,
building,"It is observed from this figure that other buildings around this building are low rise, therefore, there is a chance that the experienced ground motions had larger spectral accelerations at the natural frequency of this collapsed building.",report,,
building,"The buildings in them have several surrounding buildings with a similar number of stories and structural systems that remained intact, though experiencing damage; therefore observed collapses could be due to several deficiencies, low construction quality and any damage experienced in a prior earthquake.",report,,
building,"It is known that there is a very narrow boundary between collapse and survival for non-ductile reinforced concrete buildings, which could potentially explain why only a few of these possibly non-ductile buildings collapsed and others remained standing.",report,,

building,This earthquake demonstrated the benefits of this practice for resilience and functionality of essential services; it is hoped this encourages the greater adoption of base isolation and other protective systems beyond hospitals.,report,,
building,It is expected that damage accumulated through the previous earthquakes prior to the December 15 event.,report,,
building,"Even so, there were a , 2019, there were few partial and complete building collapses.",report,,

building,"It shows Matanao National High School at Matanao, Davao del Sur with infill walls failing under a combination of in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) effects.",report,,
building,It is noted that the interaction of IP/OOP effects for these infill walls has been added to standards only recently (see 2017 version of ASCE41).,report,,
building,The damage in it was limited to the infill failures and did not instigate the formation of weak and soft stories that could have resulted in story collapses for this school.,report,,
building,"Therefore, infill walls had a positive effect on the response of the structure, though infill wall failures can contribute negatively to building collapses as observed in previous earthquakes and possibly even above.",report,,
building,"Infill wall failures also present a high risk of injury or death due to falling masonry rubble: Vincent Fernandez, the mayor of Matanao town in Davao del Sur province, indicated that a wall collapse led to the death of a six-year-old girl.",report,,

building,"At the time this briefing was authored, many people were still trapped in the remains of the ruined buildings.",report,,
building,An illustration of insufficient detailing from a collapsed RC building is provided by it: the exposed vertical element shows a lack of transverse reinforcement and failure in a diagonal plane associated with shear damage; the horizontal element in this figure is observed to have adequately anchored transverse reinforcement with only 90-degree hooks in place of the 135-degree seismic hooks necessary for confinement.,report,,
building,"These and other non-ductile features such as the presence of strong-beam/weak-column proportions, lack of confinement at member ends and connections and weak/soft stories potentially contributed to the observed collapses.",report,,
building,One of the commonly observed damage types of RC buildings in this earthquake is the In-Plane (IP)/Out-of-Plane (OOP) failures of infill walls.,report,,
building,"Fortunately, the damage in these photos was limited to the infill failures and did not result in the formation of weak and soft stories and consequent story collapses.",report,,
building,"However, infill wall failures may have contributed to other building collapses, similar to those observed during previous earthquakes in Europe.",report,,
building,Infill wall failures also present a high risk of injury or death due to falling masonry rubble.,report,,
building,"Related to the damage in masonry buildings, photos in the figure show the presence of multicell clay blocks.",report,,
building,These blocks are not only very brittle but they afford no options for reinforcing or grouting the cells to increase the wall strength and ductility.,report,,
building,"The use of such brittle material should be outlawed in all earthquake-prone areas, including Albania and other countries around the region.",report,,

building,"These results, obtained in a fairly short time after the earthquake, have great potential to aid efficient organization of post-disaster response and recovery.",report,,
building,"In the long-term, comparison of these estimations with actual damage distributions will be helpful in evaluating the accuracy of the regional-scale simulations and making any necessary improvements, such that similar simulations, along with social science studies, can be used for decision making purposes to prepare for future earthquakes.",report,,
building,"The province of Zambales, the epicenter of the earthquake, had been spared from the earthquake destruction, while the neighboring province of Pampanga suffered damage to 29 structures/buildings and was the area most affected by the earthquake due to the presence of soft sediment and alluvial soil sites.",report,,

building,"Damage was observed in historical churches in Lubao and Porac, where the stone bell tower of the 19th-century Santa Catalina de Alejandria Church collapsed.",report,,
building,"Considering the relatively moderate level of shaking with the fact that collapse and similar damage was not observed in nearby structures, it can be stated that the collapse of the 4-story supermarket is due to the structural deficiencies such as short columns and deficient beam-column joints.",report,,
building,"Similar to many previous earthquakes, the Philippines quake highlighted the vulnerability of non-ductile reinforced concrete structures and historical masonry structures indicating the immediate need for retrofit to avoid such damages in the future.",report,,
building,"In that regard, research should continue to develop proper retrofit techniques for these types of structures, while maintaining the cultural value and distinctive architecture of historical structures.",report,,
building,A 10-story school building in Manila (Emilio Aguinaldo College) was reported to have tilted and leaned onto the adjacent building.,report,,
building,Soil liquefaction underneath the building was indicated as the probable cause.,report,,
building,"This tilting demonstrates the effect of far field ground motions and the ground motion amplification due to local soil conditions, considering that the distance between the epicenter of the earthquake and Manila is around 60 km.",report,,
building,"Furthermore, the structure being a school building increases the severity of the situation.",report,,
building,Most of the damage was concentrated in the single-family housing that appears to be non-engineered.,report,,
