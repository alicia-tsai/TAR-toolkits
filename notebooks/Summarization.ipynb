      "Four buildings, including a five-storey apartment block, collapsed in KodÃ«r-ThumanÃ« and the town was hardest hit from the earthquake. A 20-year-old woman, in a coma after she was injured by a falling brick while leaving her apartment in Tirana, died, the health ministry said on Saturday. â€œEverything was moving in an unbelievable rhythm, I could hear the walls cracking, dishes and glass breaking,â€  Videos and pictures shared on social media showed chaotic scenes of residents rummaging through the rubble, or trying to extricate people trapped under collapsed buildings. The earthquake struck at 3:54 a.m. near the Adriatic coast, about 19 miles west of Tirana, home to nearly 900,000 people. In Elbasan, a town about 35 miles from Durres, Olsi Shehi, a 39-year-old cook, said a four-story house had fallen, trapping people inside. About 2,500 people from damaged homes have been sheltered in hotels. Rescuers in Albania dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings in search of survivors on Tuesday, after a 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the Balkan nation, killing at least 23 people and injuring 650. 21, a 5.6-magnitude quake in Albania injured dozens of people and damaged hundreds of homes in the same area hit on Tuesday. He said more than 1,465 buildings in Tirana and about 900 in nearby Durres had been seriously damaged. Durres castle walls damaged by the earthquake In Albania, a large proportion of the earthquake damage has been blamed on corruption, violations of the building code and substandard construction following the demise of communism during the early 1990s. Rama said on Saturday that preliminary figures showed more than 1,465 buildings in the capital, Tirana, and about 900 in nearby Durres were seriously damaged in Tuesdayâ€™s 6.4-magnitude predawn earthquake. Of those, more than 3,000 people were injured, 14,000 became homeless and throughout Albania 14,000 buildings were damaged of which 2,500 are rendered uninhabitable. In Durres, hundreds of residents as well as Rama and President Ilir Meta attended the funeral of nine members of a single extended family who were killed when a four-storey villa collapsed. Earthquake damage is being checked by civil engineers from the European Union, United States and local experts to assess whether buildings are structurally sound, unsafe and required demolition or just needed replastering.\n"

      "The search-and-rescue operation for earthquake survivors in Albania has ended, with the death toll standing at 51 and no more bodies believed to be in the ruins, Prime Minister Edi Rama said. On 30 November Prime Minister Rama announced the end of the search and rescue operation, as no more bodies were expected to be under the rubble. In accordance with the Albanian constitution regarding an emergency situation, the Albanian parliament granted Prime Minister Edi Rama state of emergency powers to deal with earthquake aftermath. Prime Minister Rama said that the state budget was being reconfigured to manage the situation following the earthquake. In the immediate aftermath, 2,500 people became displaced by the earthquake and are temporarily being accommodated either in the Niko Dovana Stadium of DurrÃ«s in tents or in hotels. A state of emergency lasting 30 days was declared by the Albanian government for DurrÃ«s, ThumanÃ« and Tirana and later extended to LezhÃ« and LaÃ§. Blue and white coloured emergency tents for displaced people near stadium in DurrÃ«s The EU office in Albania estimated that some 1.9 million people out of a total population of 2.8 million have been affected by the earthquake. Subsequently, rescue crews with specialised equipment, sniffer dogs and emergency supplies came to Albania from neighbouring countries and other European nations to help in the search efforts and provide for those left homeless. Some students from Tirana went to assist relief efforts in DurrÃ«s and delivered hundreds of meals to earthquake affected people. Hundreds of Albanians in Albania and Kosovo opened their homes to people displaced by the earthquake.\n"

       "'USGS PAGER tool estimated the fatalities to be between 1 and 10 with a probability of 12%, between 10 and 100 with a probability of 37%, between 100 and 1,000 with a probability of 37% and between 1,000 and 10,000 with a probability of 12% (Fig. 10). At the time this briefing was authored, the number of deaths as a consequence of the earthquake was reported as 51 and there were approximately 2,000 injuries. Damages were expected to be between $1 million and $10 million, between $10 million and $100 million, and between $100 million and $1,000 million with probabilities of 8%, 25% and 36%, respectively. Furthermore, there were probabilities of 22% and 6% of the economic loss to be between $1,000 million and $10,000 million and between $10,000 million and $100,000 million, respectively. Given the severity of the situation, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama declared a state of emergency in Tirana and Durres during December. Recovery efforts are currently continuing in the rubble of collapsed buildings, where residents and emergency crews in cities across the country rescued 45 people from some of the collapsed buildings. Considering the state of emergency and current situation, the recovery and reconstruction process after this earthquake is likely to be lengthy. The earthquake left around 4,000 people homeless (Al Jazeera, 2019). Similar to many previous earthquakes, even the residents of houses and buildings that were still standing, which performed well, remained outside after the earthquake. One of the residents in the capital Tirana indicated he did not know where he would live and described his apartment as “uninhabitable.” An estimated 2,500 people have been displaced by the earthquake and are temporarily being sheltered either in the Niko Dovana Stadium of Durres in tents or in hotels (Wikipedia, 2019).'"
